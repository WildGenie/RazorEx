1000003;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to talk in the world of Britannia. First, type the word <B>Hello</B>. See how it appears at the bottom of your screen? This is where you will see the text you type while in the game. When you press enter, it will appear to the players around you. Now press the <B> Enter </B> key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000004;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>When you pressed the <b> Enter </b> key, the text you had typed appeared above your head. This lets other people know you are speaking. Also, when you see text above the head of someone else you will know they are speaking. Now we will learn how to walk and move around in the world. Move the cursor around your character. See how it changes? This will show you the direction you are going to move in. Clicking the right mouse button will make your character walk. Move the cursor near your character and single click the right mouse button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000005;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Great Job! You now know how to walk! Now follow the blue footprints on the ground by clicking and holding down the right mouse button. This will make your character continually walk instead of taking one step at a time. Continue following the footprints down the hall to a set of blue magical runes. Walk onto them when you arrive. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000006;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Perfect! Now we will learn how to <B>Pathfind</B>. Pathfinding is an automated walk which will make your character walk around any obstacles in their way. This is activated when you quickly click the right mouse button twice. Move the mouse cursor over the <B> Red </B> runes on the other side of the walls, and double-click the right mouse button.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000007;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Did you notice how your character walked around the obstacles? This is called <B>Pathfinding</B>.

1000008;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to <B>Run</B>. To Run, click and hold down the right mouse button and move the cursor closer to the edge of the screen. This will make your character Run in that direction instead of walking. Run down this hallway and follow the Blue footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000009;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You're doing great! Now continue following the blue footprints. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000010;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you will see a pair of metal doors ahead of you. Walk over and stand in front of the doors. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000011;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are standing to the side of the doors! Move over to stand directly in front of them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000012;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn how to <B>Use</B> objects. To Use an object place your cursor on it and double click the left mouse button. Doing this will allow you to open doors, open chests, and use things like spinning wheels and tools. Double left clicking on some food will let you eat it if you're hungry. Try to open the doors in front of you. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000013;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Perfect! Did you notice how the doors opened when you <B>used</B> them? Now you can walk into the next room. Please go through the open door. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000014;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we will learn more about your character, or avatar. An avatar is your in-game representation. It is how other people can interact with you. By <B>using</B> your avatar you can open your <B>Paperdoll</B>. The paperdoll allows you to see your current status, access important information and abilities, and customize your character. Double Left Click your cursor on yourself to open your paperdoll. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000015;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your paperdoll. It shows you what clothing you are currently wearing and what items you have equipped. The buttons on the right of your paperdoll are very important as they allow you to access game features. The topmost button, <B>Help</B>, will request assistance from one of our in game staff, or direct you to online information. The Help button will also help guide you to the best place to receive answers about Ultima Online. You'll be able to choose an option that best describes your situation. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000016;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll look at the <B>Options</B> button. This will allow you to change your in-game settings, such as screen resolution and text color. The <B>Logout</B> button will permit you to leave the world of Ultima Online. Below that is the <B>Skills</B> button. This will show you a more detailed listing of your character's abilities. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000017;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The <B>Journal</B> button will open up a log of recent speech and actions said and seen by you. The <B>Chat</B> button will take you to an in-game chat room to talk with other players. The <B>Peace</B> button will allow you to go into combat mode to attack monsters. We'll learn how to use that shortly. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000018;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>At the bottom, the <B>Status</B> button will give you information about your Avatar's attributes and statistics. Before we cover those, let's learn about the <B>Backpack</B>. Your backpack is in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. It is where all of your items are stored when you are not wearing or using them. It can be opened by using it. Open it now by double left clicking the cursor on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000019;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! This is your backpack. It is where you can put the items that you find and need during your adventures through Britannia. Right now, there is a banana inside your backpack. We're going to use it to learn a few more ways you can interact with items. To <B>Look</B> at an item in the world, single left click on it with the cursor. A description will appear above the item when you do this. Look at the banana by moving the cursor over the banana and clicking the left mouse button once. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000020;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the description appears above the object? You can look at any object in the world with a single left click. Let's learn how to pick up things. Picking up an object is done by single, left clicking on it, just as you did to look at it, and then holding the mouse button down. You can then drag the item around. The item will stick to the end of the mouse cursor while you are holding it. Pick up the banana by moving the mouse cursor over it, and left clicking and holding the left mouse button down. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000021;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have now picked up the banana. Move the mouse cursor around. See how the banana moves accordingly and follows it? This is how you <B>Move</B> objects around in Britannia. Move the mouse cursor back over the backpack and release the left button. This will drop the banana back inside your backpack. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000022;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You appear to have missed your backpack! The banana has been returned to your backpack for you. Clicking on, holding and dragging is how things can be moved around in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world can be used. For example, double left clicking on the banana will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000023;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you know how to <B>Move</B> an object in the world. Objects in your backpack can be <B>Used</B> just like objects in the world. For example, moving the cursor over the banana and double-clicking the left mouse button will let you <B>Eat</B> it. Eat the banana now. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000024;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>YUM! You ate the banana. There is now a blue Hat in your backpack. Clothing and other equipment can be worn and removed. This is done by picking up and dragging the equipment over to your paperdoll. First, pick up the hat. Again, you do this by moving the cursor over it, and clicking and holding down the left mouse button on it. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000025;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>You are now holding the hat. Be careful! You don't want to release the mouse button, as that would drop it. Drag the hat over to your head in the paperdoll and release the button. Doing this will <B>Equip</B> the hat. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000026;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have dropped the hat! I have returned it to your backpack. Try to pick up the hat again. Do this by moving the cursor over it, and left clicking and holding down the button. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000027;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>GREAT! You have <B>Equipped</B> the hat. See how it appears on your avatar as well as your paperdoll? You can equip clothing, weapons and armor in the same way as the hat. Now, let's learn how to take it off. Move the mouse cursor over the hat on your paperdoll, and left click and hold down the mouse button to pick it up. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000028;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you are holding the hat again. Drag the hat over the backpack and release the left mouse button to drop it in. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000029;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Oops! You appear to have missed the backpack! The hat has been returned to your backpack. Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000030;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Wonderful! Now that you know how to use and manipulate items in the world we are going to learn a little bit about moving the in-game windows around. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000031;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>First, look in the lower right corner of your paperdoll. Do you see the <B>Dash symbol (-)</B>? This is the <B>Minimize</B> button. It appears on almost all of the windows in Ultima Online. Single left clicking on it will shrink down the window for convenience. Left click on the paperdoll minimize button, or dash symbol. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000032;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>See how the paperdoll has shrunk down to a button-looking window that says <B>Character</B>? This is the minimized version of the paperdoll window. It can be moved around by left clicking and dragging just like any other window. To restore the paperdoll, you just double left click on the Character window. Double left click on it now.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000033;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we'll learn how to <B>Close</B> a window. To close any window, simply single right click on it. Single right click on your paperdoll window. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000034;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To reopen your paperdoll, simply double left click on your avatar. Now you know how to move, minimize, restore, and close all of the windows available to you. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000035;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now you'll have a chance to use a little of what you have just learned. Inside of this room is a Red <B>Moongate</B>. A Moongate is a magical portal, which will teleport you elsewhere. The moongate is inside the smaller room with 8 doors. Walk over to these doors, and <B>Use</B> them. (Hint: Double left click on the doors!). After you have opened the doors, walk into the moongate. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000036;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn more about your avatar. Move the mouse cursor over your avatar. Now single click the left mouse button, hold it down, and drag the cursor off of your character. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000037;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is your <B>Status Bar</B>. It is a handy representation of your avatar's characteristics. There are 3 major characteristics shown here. The first, and most important is the topmost bar. This represents your avatar's <B>Health</B>. Health shows you how hurt your character is. Your Health decreases when you are wounded. As your Health drops lower, the blue bar will shrink. Let's see what this looks like. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000038;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Your Health has been lowered to half. See how the bar is now half blue and half red? The blue portion of the bar shows you how close you are to your maximum in that characteristic. So if you have very little blue left, watch out! Your other characteristics will work the same way. Health regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue and restore your Health to full. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000039;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next characteristic, shown as the middle bar, is <B>Mana</B>. Mana shows you how much magical energy that your character has available. Casting a spell will decrease your available Mana. Mana regenerates naturally over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000040;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last characteristic is the bottom bar. This bar measures your current <B>Stamina</B>. The stamina bar lets you know how tired you are. Running, fighting, and other physical activities will decrease your stamina. Be careful not to let your stamina reach 0, as you will become too tired to move! Stamina, just like Health and Mana, regenerates over time. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000041;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to take a closer look at your status. The Status Bar can be maximized to a more detailed Status window by double left clicking on the bar. Maximize the bar now. Press the Next button when you have done this. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000042;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>As you can see this window gives you much more detail about your character. It gives you the number value of your current and maximum Health, Mana, and Stamina, as well as several other statistics. The first statistic, <B>STR</B> is your <B>Strength</B>. This is a measure of how strong and durable your avatar is. The higher your strength is, the more Health you have, and the more you excel at physical activity. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000043;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The next statistic is <B>DEX</B> which stands for your <B>Dexterity</B>. This represents how agile and quick you are. If your Dexterity is very high, you will be able to dodge attacks, and perform physical activities more quickly. Dexterity also affects the amount of Stamina you have. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000044;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The last Statistic is <B>INT</B> which is for your <B>Intelligence</B>. This represents how smart you are. A character with a high Intelligence will excel at mental activities such as spell casting. Intelligence also determines the amount of Mana that you have available. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000045;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next, <B>SEX</B> shows whether your character is Male or Female. Below that is <B>AR</B> or Armor Rating. AR represents how well protected your character is. The higher the AR, the better protected from damage you are. Press the Next button to continue.</CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000046;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Next are the number values of Health, Stamina and Mana. Below that is <B>Gold</B>. This tells you how much money you currently have. Below that is <B>Weight</B>. Weight is an indicator of how much you are carrying. The more weight you are carrying, the more stamina you will lose during normal physical activity. Excessive weight will prevent you from moving at all! Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000047;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now that you are more familiar with your character, close the Status window with a single right click. Now follow the Red footprints down the hall. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000048;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Continue to follow the footprints into the next room. Inside you will see a number of avatars. These are NPC's, or Non-Player Characters. NPC's are avatars that are run by the game. In this case, these NPC's are <B>Shopkeepers</B>. Shopkeepers will buy and sell items from players. Walk over to one of the NPC's and stand right next to them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000049;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>NPC's have a paperdolls just like you do. You open an NPC's paperdoll, just as you would open your own.  Simply double left click on them. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000050;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>The NPC paperdoll shows information about the NPC just as yours does. The clothing and equipment worn are shown as well as the NPC's name and profession. The <B>Status</B> of an NPC can be opened from the paperdoll as well. Close the NPC Paperdoll with a single right click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000051;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now we're going to learn how to buy and sell from an NPC. NPC's respond to speech, just like players do, but they require gold for their wares. Some gold has been placed in your backpack. Like all of your other items, gold is stored in your backpack. Open your paperdoll with a double left click on your avatar. Then, open your backpack with a double left click. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000052;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>Now close your Paperdoll. (HINT: Single right click on it.). Your backpack will remain open. Inside of your backpack you will see some <B>Gold</B>. Looking at the stack of gold will show you the amount you possess. You currently have 10 gold pieces. We are going to use this gold to buy something from this Shopkeeper. Press the Next button to continue. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000053;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>To let a NPC shopkeeper know you wish to buy from them, you must type in <B>Vendor Buy</B>. Type this in now and press the Enter key. </CENTER></BASEFONT></BODY>;Original
1000054;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0><CENTER>This is the <B>Buy</B> window. Here you can make your selection from the wares of a shop. In this case, this vendor sells loaves of bread. The top portion of the window shows the name of the item, the cost, and the amount available. The bottom portion will display what items you have selected as well as the total cost of your items.

1002080;This skill is also useful for other reasons. By using this skill on a living person, you may be able to determine their membership in the Thieves guild. Your ability to determine this is based on their skill level as a thief.;Original
1002081;You can also use your detective skills to determine who recently picked the locks on locked containers and determine members of the Thieves Guild. Simply use the Forensic Evaluation skill, and target the item you wish to examine. You must be a skilled detective to begin this practice, as you will not be able to begin learning this skill until you have a skill level of 40.;Original
1002082;Healing;Original
1002083;Use of the healing skill will allow you to heal yourself or other players. To use the skill, simply double click a bandage, and target yourself or the person you wish to heal. If you are successful in your efforts, the recipient will regain health, and the bandage will be used up. To create bandages, simply use scissors on cloth.;Original
1002084;If you are healing another player, you must be near them during your efforts, if you leave their vicinity, your efforts will be in vain. If you are disturbed during your work, your fingers can easily slip, and your efforts will have less or no effect.;Original
1002085;A highly skilled healer may be able to cure poisons or even resurrect other players. To accomplish this, you must be skilled in both healing, and anatomy. To cure poison, you must have a minimum of 60 skill in each area, and above 80 skill in each area, you may be able to resurrect ghosts.;Original
1002086;Herding;Original
1002087;Use of this skill will allow you to herd animals. To use this skill you must have a shepherd's crook. Double click the crook, and you will be given a targeting cursor. Simply target the animal you wish to herd, and then click the location you wish the animal to move to. The higher your skill, the more likely you are to successfully herd the animal.;Original
1002088;Hiding;Original
1002089;The hiding skill allows you to become invisible to other players. To use this skill, simply click the gem next to it in the skill list. If successful, you will become invisible to other players and monsters. You will be revealed if you move, speak, cast a spell, loot a body, attack someone or something, and other possible ways. It can be very difficult or impossible to hide while you are being attacked, so make sure to run a good distance away from your enemy and exit combat mode before attempting to hide. While you are hidden, you are not totally impervious to detection or attack. You can be revealed by spellcasters, the Detect Hidden skill, and can be tracked using the tracking skill. You can also take damage from area effect spells, and purple potions. You must remain wary even while hidden.;Original
1002090;Inscription;Original
1002091;This skill is used primarily to transcribe spells onto blank scrolls. To inscribe a spell onto a scroll, you must know the spell, have enough mana, and have the appropriate reagents for that spell in your pack (reagents will be consumed in the attempt). To begin, select the inscription skill from your skill list, then select a blank scroll. A scrolling list will appear which displays all of the spells you are capable of casting. From this list, select the spell you wish to inscribe.;Original
1002092;To copy a spell from a scroll onto a spellbook, drag the scroll onto the book. Inscription is not necessary to do this.;Original
1002093;To cast a spell from a scroll you can simply double click the scroll, and the spell will be cast. There are intelligence and magery requirements for casting spells from scrolls, but they are substantially lower than the requirements to cast them using magery.;Original
1002094;Item Identification;Original
1002095;Item Identification, if used successfully, will allow you to gather information about the chosen item. To use the skill simply click on the button and then click on the item to be identified. You will be given a description that varies in detail and accuracy depending on your skill level. (Depending on the ability of the user, the evaluation may be off by up to 50%);Original
1002096;Once you have identified an item, you will retain knowledge about that item.  Others will not benefit from your discovery, however.  They will have to identify the item themselves.;Original
1002097;Lockpicking;Original
1002098;The lockpicking skill is exactly that, it is used to open locked items. In order to attempt to pick a lock, you must have a set of lockpicks in your pack. Lockpicks can be purchased from thief shopkeepers.  Double-click on your lockpicks, and then target the item to be picked. Some locks are harder to pick than others (and some, such as house doors, are impossible to pick). Your skill level will determine your success rate.  If you are successful the lock will be picked, and you can open the item.;Original
1002099;This skill is especially useful in hunting treasure from treasure maps. The treasure chests that are found will be locked and often trapped. Use of this skill along with detect hidden (to find any traps) will prove useful.;Original
1002100;Lumberjacking;Original
1002101;The use of the lumberjacking skill will allow you to gain raw materials in the form of logs. The logs can then be used for carpentry, bowyering, or tinkering. Simply equip a hatchet or an axe, double click the weapon and then click on a tree. If you are successful in recovering wood it will be placed in your pack.;Original
1002102;Mace Fighting;Original
1002103;Mace fighting is a melee combat skill, which allows for an quick attack style of fighting.  A mace fighter is capable of using a War Axe, Club, Hammer Pick, Mace, Magic Wand, Maul, Smithy Hammer, War Hammer, War Mace, Black Staff, Gnarled Staff, Quarterstaff, and Shepherd's Crook in combat to great effect.;Original
1002104;Due to the heavy bashing of a mace weapon, mace fighters have the ability to damage the armor of their opponents and remove their stamina.;Original
1002105;Mace fighting, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the weapon equipped you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.;Original
1002106;Magery;Original
1002107;This skill will allow you to cast a variety of spells in the game. The magery skill is automatically checked when you attempt to cast a spell, and your skill level will determine your chances of success in the attempt. To cast a spell, your hands must be free of any items (except a spellbook), you must have a spellbook with the appropriate spell contained therein, and you must have the appropriate reagents in your pack. Simply open the spellbook, choose the spell that you wish to cast, and double click the spell name. You can also click once on the spell name to get a more complete description of the spell, along with a 'tile' that represents the spell. If you wish, you can 'drag' the tile to your play area, and cast the spell by double clicking on the tile. Depending on the spell that you cast, you will be given different options for the next step, but the success or failure of your casting depends on your magery level.;Original
1002108;If your spellbook does not contain a spell you wish to use often, simply acquire a scroll for that spell, and drag it into your spellbook. This spell will be added to the spells available for your use from this book.;Original
1002109;It is also possible to cast a spell from a scroll. The proper reagents and skill are necessary to prepare the scroll initially, so casting from a scroll requires no reagents, and can be done with a lower level of skill.;Original
1002110;Mages benefit greatly from meditation and evaluate intelligence skills.  Meditation improves the rate at which a mage regains lost mana and evaluate intelligence allows a mage to overcome an opponent's resistance to the mage's magic.;Original
1002111;Mining;Original
1002112;Cultivating the mining skill enables you to harvest the seams of ore that lie in the mines and mountains of Britannia. This ore can then be smelted into ingots (using the mining skill) and the ingots can then be used to craft various items, such as armor (using the blacksmithing skill).;Original
1002113;To mine ore you must have either a shovel or a pickaxe in your possession. Double-click on the axe or shovel and then, when the targeting cursor appears, click on a mountainside or a cave wall. If successful, you will mine either a small, medium, or large pile of ore, dependent upon a number of factors. The known ore types, in order of their prevalence, are Iron (the most common), Dull Copper, Shadow Iron, Copper, Bronze, Golden, Agapite, Verite, and Valorite.;Original
1002114;The rarity and chances of finding various ores varies directly with the skill level necessary to mine it. The more rare the ore, the higher the skill level necessary to mine it.;Original
1002115;A miner who is also a tinker will often be able to be self-sufficient.  Tinkers are able to create shovels and pickaxes necessary for miners.;Original
1002116;Musicianship;Original
1002117;Use of the musicianship skill will allow you to play an instrument. The ability to play an instrument is necessary for some other skills such as discordance, provocation, and peacemaking. To use this skill, simply double click the instrument of your choice. A music sample will play if you succeed, but an ugly noise will occur if you fail. The higher your skill level, the greater your chances of playing a pretty tune.;Original
1002118;Parrying;Original
1002119;This skill is used to determine your proficiency at blocking attacks with a shield. If you are using a shield, this skill is checked automatically each time that you are attacked. If successful, your attacker may miss his attack, or do less damage than normal.;Original
1002120;Peacemaking;Original
1002121;Use of the peacemaking skill will allow you to stop all fights in your immediate area. This skill is related to your musicianship skill, and will automatically check this skill when you use peacemaking. To use the skill, you must click the jewel in your skills list, and then click on your instrument (or the game will remember the last instrument that you played). If you are successful, all fights in the immediate area will stop, at least for a moment. The higher your musicianship and peacemaking skills, the more likely you are to be successful.;Original
1002122;Poisoning;Original
1002123;The poisoning skill can be used to poison a weapon or even food and drink. This will cause damage to whoever is attacked with the poisoned weapon, or to whoever consumes the food or drink. To poison a weapon simply use the skill from your skill list, and then select the vial of poison you wish to use, and finally click on the item you wish to poison. If you poison a weapon, you will lose karma.  This item will now be poisoned until you use it. Once the poisoned weapon is used you will have to repeat the process to poison it again. The same process is used to poison food or drink. Select the skill and then click on the vial of poison. Then click on the consumable, and presto! The food or drink is now poisoned for a period of time. To create the vial of poison you will need to have the reagent nightshade, and then mix it in pestle and mortar. Once it is mixed, it will pour into the empty bottle in your pack. You can then use this green potion to poison items.;Original
1002124;When you wish to poison an item, DO NOT double click the green potion first. If you do this, you will drink the poison. This does not give you the results you had hoped for, as you will have just poisoned yourself.;Original
1002125;Provocation;Original
1002126;This skill is used to encourage other creatures to fight one other. You will need a musical instrument to accomplish this task. To use the skill, first select the provocation skill from the skills list, target the instrument you wish to use (or the game will remember the one you last used), and then click in turn on each of the creatures you wish to fight one another. If you are successful the two creatures will fight for a time consistent with their respective natures and dispositions. Please keep in mind that you cannot provoke other characters.;Original
1002127;Reagents;Original
1002128;Black Pearls are rare, and are often referred to as the reagent of movement. When finely ground into a powder, black pearls can invoke spells that teleport of propel the caster to another location.;Original
1002129;Blood Moss takes its name from its reddish color. Prevalent in wetter surroundings (such as marshes or swamps), this type of fungi is a base reagent for spells involving locomotion or animation.;Original
1002130;The ground paste of a ripe bulb of garlic has a reputation for warding off evil. This effect accurately describes its use as a reagent as well. Modern magicians use garlic in spells that protect the caster (or a specified target) or dispel danger.;Original
1002131;Ginseng is hailed as the reagent of health, as its syrup bestows both healing and restoration. Common Britannia folk use it as a home remedy for fatigue and sickness, but true magicians appreciate ginseng for its magical qualities and always keep a healthy portion on hand.;Original
1002132;Mandrake Root is harder to find than other reagents, although it is probably the most commonly used of the eight base reagents. Like blood moss, it thrives in dark, dank, areas, where most dare not venture. Those that do search out this precious root are rewarded by being able to cast spells invoking strength and energy.;Original
1002133;The nightshade plant is as deadly as its long-standing reputation. Its touch can poison a human; in a magical spell, it invokes powers of death, damage and illusion.;Original
1002134;Spider's silk is an inexpensive reagent, as it is quite plentiful and light on one's back, even in large quantities. However, it is so fine that massive amounts of fibers are consumed by a single spell. True to its origin as webbing, this reagent calls forth summoning and binding spells.;Original
1002135;Foul smelling but powerful, sulphurous ash is a dusty volcanic residue. It is found mainly in Britannia's mountainous regions and is a common element of any spell releasing fire, light, or explosive energy.;Original
1002136;Remove Trap;Original
1002137;The skilled rogue will be able to disarm traps using the Remove Trap skill. In order to begin learning the art of removing traps you must first demonstrate proficiency at Lockpicking, and Detect Hidden. You must have a base level of 50 skill in both of those skills before you can begin your training in this area. To use the Remove Trap skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and target the item that you wish to disarm. If you are successful in your attempt, you will disarm the trap. Failure to disarm the trap stands the possibility of setting off the trap. The higher your skill level, the more difficult the trap you can disarm. You must be very careful when using this skill, it can be quite a risky proposition. To disarm traps, you must be quite nimble, and will find that wearing gloves makes this process much more difficult.;Original
1002138;Snooping;Original
1002139;The Snooping skill is used to see into another player's backpack. To use the snooping skill, simply double click on another player's pack, and if you are successful, the pack will appear open to you on the screen. Be warned however that a large majority of players do not care for a player who frequents the use of this skill. This skill is best used in conjunction with stealing. To steal from other players, you must be a member of the thief's guild.;Original
1002140;Spirit Speak;Original
1002141;Spirit Speak is used to be able to understand the speech of ghosts. If you do not have this skill you will only be able to see a series of "oooooo"s emanating from the deceased. To use this skill, simply use the skill from the skill list, and if you are successful you will be able to understand the ghost. Keep in mind that the length of time the interpretation lasts is directly related to the level of skill you have attained and your level of intelligence.;Original
1002142;Stealing;Original
1002143;The skilled Pickpocket may be able to steal items in several manners, from a variety of sources. You may be able to steal from monsters, chests, NPC's, or other players (if you are a member of the thieves guild, or if they are an opponent in a guild war). You can attempt to steal in two ways. First, use the skill from your skill list, and target the container, creature, NPC, or player. This is a 'random steal' and will attempt to steal an item at random from this source. The second method is to first 'snoop' the container using your snooping skill, and then select a specific object to steal. Dragging this item into your inventory will check your stealing skill to determine your chances of success. The skilled pickpocket must be very dexterous in his or her work, and will find that the more armor you are wearing, the harder it will be to steal.;Original
1002144;There are four possible outcomes to stealing:;Original
1002145;-  True Success: you get the item and are not noticed;Original
1002146;-  Partial Success: you get the item, but are noticed;Original
1002147;-  Partial Failure: you do not get the item, but are not noticed;Original
1002148;-  Total failure: you do not get the item, and your attempt is noticed;Original
1002149;If your attempt is noticed, the guards can be called on you, so you must be very careful when attempting these practices. It is also important to note that for two minutes after stealing, the member of the Thieves' Guild is freely attackable by anyone in the area. In towns, the proscription against starting fights still applies, so even Thieves' Guild members will be safe from random attack, even if everyone knows of their affiliation.;Original
1002150;As mentioned above, you will not be able to steal from other players unless you are a member of the thieves guild, or unless the target is an opponent in a guild war. You can join the thieves guild in the usual manner, by finding a Thief Guildmaster and asking him to join. There will be an entrance fee, and there are several entrance requirements. Your character must have adventured in the world for at least one week, must not have any murders to his name, and must have already demonstrated proficiency in stealing (60 skill minimum). The requirements to stay in the guild are stringent as well. If you are reported for murder, you will be summarily ejected from the guild, and cannot rejoin for one week. Also, once you join the guild, you cannot leave for one week, unless ejected from the guild. Thieves Guild members cannot report murders, and thus could be considered "freely" attackable anywhere in the world (except in justice regions, unless they steal from another player).;Original
1002151;Swordsmanship;Original
1002152;Swordsmanship is a melee combat skill, which allows for a strong-arm attack style of fighting.  A swordsperson is capable of using an axe, a battle axe, a double axe, an executioner's axe, a hatchet, a large battle axe, a pickaxe, a two-handed axe, a butcher knife, a cleaver, a skinning knife, a bardiche, a halberd, a broad sword, a cutlass, a katana, a longsword, a scimitar, or a viking sword in combat to slice there opponents to ribbons.;Original
1002153;Only the one-handed weapons of a swordsman can be poisoned.  You must be careful when using a poison weapon, as the poison will damage the weapon and make it more likely to break.;Original
1002154;Swordsmanship, like the other melee combat skills, requires that you have the appropriate weapon equipped.  Once you have the appropriate weapon equipped, you will need to enter war mode.  You will need to double-click on an opponent to attack them.;Original
1002155;Tailoring;Original
1002156;Use of the tailoring skill will allow you to make a wide variety of items, ranging from bandages to clothing, and even leather armor. Your raw materials can come from a variety of sources, from hunting animals for leather, to gathering cotton and spinning thread. You can also purchase materials from a vendor and craft them into items for resale.;Original
1002157;To get leather from a cow, you will need to kill it and skin it.  In order to skin the cow, use a bladed weapon on the carcass.  This will leave hides on the corpse.  You may also get hides from other animals.;Original
1002158;You may purchase cloth, or you may also find cotton lying in fields.  If you do find cotton, you may use the cotton.  This will bring up a targeting cursor.  Select a spinning wheel to use the cotton on and it will produce cloth.;Original
1002159;Once you have your raw materials, you can make a wide variety of items. You need a sewing kit to tailor these items. A sewing kit can be purchased from a tailor.  Use the sewing kit with the materials in your pack. You will be given a window presenting the categories and items that you can craft with your skill level and materials. Choose the item you wish to make, and target the material if necessary. If you are successful, the item will be placed in your pack. If you do not have room in your pack, you will be unable to create the item. As your skill level rises, you will be able to make more complex items, and your chances for success will increase. After creating some items, you may wish to dye them to increase their appeal. You can do this by purchasing a dye tub, and some dyes. Just double click the dyes and select the tub you wish to use them on, then select the color you wish the tub to be. You can then dye items by double clicking the tub, and targeting the item you wish to dye.;Original
1002160;Taste ID;Original
1002161;Use of Taste Identification will allow you to determine the sort of potion you have in your possession, or to determine if an object is poisoned or not. Simply use the skill from the jewel on your skill list, and then target the item you wish to taste. If successful, you will be told what kind of potion it is (if the object is a potion) or whether or not it's poisoned (if it's not a potion).;Original
1002162;Tinkering;Original
1002163;The tinkering skill is used to make tools for other professions, and also to make clocks, sextants, and to trap containers. With this skill you can make hammers, tongs, scissors, smoothing planes, and numerous other tools. To make these tools and assorted items you will need a set of tinker's tools. First double-click on the tinker's tools, and then select your supply of metal or wood. A window will open displaying the items that you can make from the raw materials available (either wood or metal). You will need ingots for metal and boards for wood.  Some additional items may be necessary, such as gems for rings.;Original
1002164;To place a trap on a container you must have a chest or other container, a poison potion, explosive potion, or crossbow bolt, and a small supply of metal. Use your tinker tools, then target your metal, and choose the type of trap you wish to make. Last, target the container you wish to trap. If successful, the container will become trapped, and the trap you have created will affect the next person who illegally opens this item. Using the proper key on this container will bypass the trap and allow you to open the chest safely. The strength of your trap will be directly related to your skill as a tinker.;Original
1002165;Tracking;Original
1002166;The tracking skill will allow you to track animals, monsters, and people. Use the skill by clicking the jewel on your skill list. You will be presented with a window, which will allow you to choose what you wish to track. Double-click the category you wish to track (animal, human, or monster), and you will be presented with a second window listing the specific PCs or NPC's that you can track. If you are successful, and an appropriate creature can be tracked, you will be told in what direction that creature can be found. The higher your skill level in tracking, the more likely you are to successfully track an object, and the farther you will be able to track it.;Original
1002167;Veterinary;Original
1002168;The veterinary skill will allow you to heal animals in much the same way that the healing skill works on people. To use the skill, simply double-click on a bandage, you will receive a targeting cursor, and then target the animal you wish to heal. The amount of healing that you provide will be based on your skill level.;Original
1002169;Wrestling;Original
1002170;This skill is used while in hand-to-hand combat (no weapon equipped). It is checked automatically when you fight, and may determine the frequency, and damage level with which you will strike your opponent. ;Original
1002171;The wrestling skill has several uses in combat and may even be used to stun opponents.  If you do not have a weapon equipped and you attack a creature, your wrestling skill will come into play.;Original

1011020;Many people in town can improve your skills. To find out if I can improve skills you are interested in simply walk up to me and say 'TRAIN'. I will give you a list of the skills that I'm proficient in. To choose the skill you want to train in, say 'TRAIN' and the name of the skill you'd like to be trained in, and I will tell you the cost. Drag the gold from your backpack and drop it onto me, and your skill will be increased. If you don't have enough for the full payment, you can pay less but your training won't be as complete and you won't gain as much skill as you could if you paid the full amount. The amount of skill that can be raised is dependant on the ability of the teacher, so it is best to seek out Grand Masters when trying to learn the most about a particular skill. Remember that there is an overall limit to the amount of skills that you can learn, so you may not want to try to learn all of the skills in this manner.;Original

1011038;Hello. I am a shopkeeper. If you would like to buy or sell any items, then simply find a shopkeeper and say to them 'VENDOR BUY' in order to see the list of items they sell, or 'VENDOR SELL' in order to see if they're interested in buying anything you own. If you do have any items in your pack that a vendor is interested in purchasing, saying 'VENDOR SELL' will cause him to look through your pack and show you a list of the items he's interested in, as well as what he'll pay for each item. If he's not interested in anything you possess, he will let you know that as well. To purchase an item, simply look through the list that appears when you say 'VENDOR BUY' and select any item you can afford. It will appear at the bottom of your list, along with a running total of your current purchases.;Original

1011448;The followers of Minax have taken control in the old lands, and intend to hold it for as long as they can. Allying themselves with orcs, headless, gazers, trolls, and other beasts, they seek revenge against Lord British, for slights both real and imagined, though some of the followers wish only to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace.;Original
1011449;The council of Mages have their roots in the city of Moonglow, where they once convened. They began as a small movement, dedicated to calling forth the Stranger, who saved the lands once before.  A series of war and murders and misbegotten trials by those loyal to Lord British has caused the group to take up the banner of war.;Original
1011450;True Britannians are loyal to the throne of Lord British. They refuse to give up their homelands to the vile Minax, and detest the Shadowlords for their evil ways. In addition, the Council of Mages threatens the existence of their ruler, and as such they have armed themselves, and prepare for war with all.;Original
1011451;The Shadow Lords are a faction that has sprung up within the ranks of Minax. Comprised mostly of undead and those who would seek to be necromancers, they pose a threat to both the sides of good and evil. Their plans have disrupted the hold Minax has over Felucca, and their ultimate goal is to destroy all life.;Original

1014039;The weapons trainer? Ah, that is on the north edge of town, on the eastern bank of the river. 'Tis called the Cavalry Guild.;Original

1014083;Farewell.;Original
1014084;Goodbye.;Original
1014085;Greetings.;Original
1014086;Hello.;Original
1014087;Here.  In Town.;Original
1014088;I accept.;Original
1014089;I am well.;Original
1014090;I cannot help thee.;Original
1014091;I cannot speak but fondly on my homeland. Yet I would not forgo an opportunity to see other lands.;Original
1014092;I can't take it. Sorry.;Original
1014093;I don't want it. Sorry.;Original
1014094;I have heard that the great dungeons sometimes have great treasures.;Original
1014095;I know not of which thou doth speak.;Original
1014096;I live here in _Town_.;Original
1014097;I live in the town that thou art standing in.;Original
1014098;I really don't need it.;Original
1014099;I shall accept with pleasure.;Original
1014100;I shall be happy to take it!  Thank thee!;Original
1014101;I will take it, then.;Original
1014102;I work here in town.;Original
1014103;I work in the town that thou art in.;Original
1014104;I would not live in Buccaneer's Den if I were thee, for it is home to the most vile men and women to sail the seas.;Original
1014105;If thou art able to hunt the wild animals, sometimes thou can sell the meat that thou dost carve from them to a butcher.;Original
1014106;If thou art wanting a respite from the rigors of Britannia, then thou can make a camp or check in to an Inn, whichever is the most convenient.;Original
1014107;If thou can get an axe, perhaps thou could cut some trees into useful boards for woodworkers. They may be willing to pay thee for them.;Original
1014108;If thou dost happen upon some ore, go to the blacksmith's shop and try to craft some armor or weapons. I have heard that it just takes practice.;Original
1014109;If thou dost want to earn money, practice a skill. Make things and sell them to the public. Most shopkeepers will let thee use the tools and materials that they aren't using.;Original
1014110;I'm doing relatively well.;Original
1014111;Iolo? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.;Original
1014112;It's essential to have good kindling and a bedroll if thou dost want to camp.;Original
1014113;I've been needing one of these.;Original
1014114;I've heard that Lord Blackthorn has written a couple of books describing his philosophies in-depth. If thou dost find these, I imagine thou wouldst be able to say better than I what Blackthorn is about.;Original
1014115;Just fine.;Original
1014116;Let's see... I remember the names of Shame, Wrong, Despise, and Hythloth. I've never owned a map of Britannia myself.;Original
1014117;Lord Blackthorn wishes the freedom of choice in ALL things extended to everyone. Some say that he'd even sees the Orcs and Lizardmen as equals to the humans in Britannia.;Original
1014118;Lord Shamino? Ah, yes, Lord British's friend and ally, I believe.;Original
1014119;Not a problem.;Original
1014120;Only the bravest knights belong to the Order of the Silver Serpent. 'Twas they who defeated the forces of Lord Robere.;Original
1014121;Our moons are called Trammel and Felucca. They control the moongates.;Original
1014122;Please back away a bit.;Original
1014123;Please, keep it. I don't want it.;Original
1014124;Right here.;Original
1014125;Shrines to the virtues are spread around our land. I've heard that they can even resurrect the dead.;Original
1014126;Tanners will buy hides and pelts that thou dost take from the animals thou dost hunt.;Original
1014127;Thank thee!;Original
1014128;Thank thee, but I don't want it.;Original
1014129;Thank thee. Don't need any.;Original
1014130;The moongates? They are... doors to different parts of Britannia. Except the destinations of the doors change with the phases of the two moons.;Original
1014131;The name is familiar to me... ah, yes -- I believe he is the infrequent guest of Lord British. Mayhaps thou wilt find him sampling the local spirits.;Original
1014132;There are many as yet unmapped places beneath Britannia. 'Tis rumored to be riches and magic in them. And creatures that will rend the flesh from thy bones.;Original
1014133;This will come in handy indeed.;Original
1014134;Thou art most kind!;Original
1014135;Thou art most kind, but it isn't anything that I need.;Original
1014136;Thou art nearer to me than I like.;Original
1014137;Thou can find a good deal of treasure under Britannia. Look to the caves and what thou call dungeons.;Original
1014138;Thou can sell feathers from birds to a bowyer. And a cook may purchase the bird itself from thee.;Original
1014139;Thou shouldst be able to get kindling from any wood thou finds. If thou has an axe, of course.;Original
1014140;Thou shouldst learn to use the moongates if thou dost plan to travel far. The key is in the phases of the moons.;Original
1014141;Though a kind and generous man in his youth, Lord Robere thirsted for power in his later years, so legends say.  Had not the Order of the Silver Serpent been ready to fight for Lord British, this very land could have belonged to the ambitious conqueror.;Original
1014142;Thou'rt welcome.;Original
1014143;Tis the bay that touches the city of Britain.;Original
1014144;Tis very generous of thee, but I don't need it.;Original
1014145;Tis very generous of thee.;Original
1014146;Various issues surface from time to time, such as taxation, invasion, protection form creatures of the wild.;Original
1014147;Vesper? 'Tis a city in northeastern Britannia. Ore from the mines of Minoc are sent down river to be unloaded in Vesper.;Original
1014148;Well, well, what have we here?;Original
1014149;Why standest thou so near to me?;Original
1014150;Wilt thou stand back a bit;Original
1014151;Aye, we have a tanner. He's in the center o' town.;Original
1014152;Britain thou'rt askin' about? I'm told 'tis the biggest city in the land. Don't see what all t'fuss is about. The size of hereabouts is plenty big for me.;Original
1014153;Britain? 'Tis the capital of the whole wide world, o'course. Sits on the shore of Britanny Bay way off yonder.;Original
1014154;Healing shrines are found all about Britannia.;Original
1014155;I know nothing of any avatar.;Original
1014156;I may have heard a legend of a city called Wind. It was in the mountains, if I recall.;Original
1014157;If thou'rt looking for Trinsic, 'tis south, but along the eastern coast.;Original
1014158;I've never seen Lord British myself.;Original
1014159;Jhelom? 'Tis to be found at the very most northern tip of the largest Valarian Isles.;Original
1014160;Nujel'm is an island city. Part of Britannia, but ... different.;Original
1014161;Ocllo ... hmmm. 'Tis an island, I believe.;Original
1014162;Our healer sets to the east side, between the two bridges. If thou seest the inn, thou hast gone too far north.;Original
1014163;Our inn is up past the northern bridge.;Original
1014164;Right beside the woodworker and blacksmith, thou'lt find our bathhouse.;Original
1014165;Skara Brae? Thou canst not get more west than that!;Original
1014166;The blacksmith is to the northwest, past the bath house.;Original
1014167;The provisioner is southmost in town.;Original
1014168;The tanner set up shop south of the healer.;Original
1014169;The taverns are south, west of the provisioner.;Original
1014170;The woodworker is next to the blacksmith.;Original
1014171;Thou'rt in Buccaneer's Den.;Original
1014172;Trinsic? 'Tis near the Cape of Heroes, I think.;Original
1014173;Verity Isle is Moonglow's whereabouts. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.;Original
1014174;Vesper can be found on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.;Original
1014175;Yew ... ahh, that is near to Empath Abbey. That's the land from whence the best wine comes.;Original
1014176;I know many virtuous people.;Original
1014177;If thou'rt in need of medical attention, there is none better to visit than our healer on the southern side of our village.;Original
1014178;Our armourer is a fine hand with metal and leather. Feel free to view his wares in his shop two or three doors north of the healer.;Original
1014179;Our lighthouse stands proud and straight to the north of the village ... not even a long walk's distance.;Original
1014180;The orcs are bolder here than they dare elsewhere. They come from the fort to the south.;Original
1014181;The orcs live safe in their fortress to the south, and when they set out, we have no warning.;Original
1014182;This is Cove, friend. Not as fancy as a big city town, but a good place, with good people.;Original
1014183;We have a small dock. 'Tis on the north side of town, right on the water, o'course.;Original
1014184;A bit of action, eh? The Dueling Pit is in the center of town, of course.;Original
1014185;Cemetery? We've got one, sadly a necessity, and it's to the far west of town.;Original
1014186;Docks? Why, there are no less than four docks in Jhelom. One to the east of the main town, and one to the south, another on our northernmost island, and one on our southernmost isle.;Original
1014187;Food can be most easily purveyed from the small shop a bit north and east of the town's southern docks.;Original
1014188;If thou art looking for Jhelom's inn, it is north of the main southern docks.;Original
1014189;I'll not ask thy business at the Thieves' Guild. 'Tis just south of the Dueling Pit, beneath the Library.;Original
1014190;I'm told our weapons shop is one of the best. It is west and south from the Dueling Pit.;Original
1014191;In my opinion, we have a fine woodworker. I'd call his shop south-central, though 'tis a bit to the east.;Original
1014192;Indeed, the Fighters' Guild is in Jhelom. In fact, there are two. One is at the northern edge of the town, just west of the blacksmith. One is the farthest building south.;Original
1014193;Jhelom is any mercenary's second home. 'Tis no finer place for selling thy sword arm. While it's still attached, at least.;Original
1014194;Last I saw, there was a mage's shop just north of the theater. That's on the southern isle, thou knowest.;Original
1014195;Library? We've got one, friend, and it's just south of the Dueling Pit.;Original
1014196;Lord British? Why, he's our ruler, of course!;Original
1014197;Our tinker is north and east of the main isle's southern gate.;Original
1014198;Ranches are on the north-most island.;Original
1014199;Sure, every fighter is interested in armor. My favorite is the nearest building to the eastern gate. There's another, too, at the south end of town.;Original
1014200;The baker is north of the Weapons shop, west of the Dueling Pit.;Original
1014201;The best place to buy fish is found just east of the Dueling Pit.;Original
1014202;The clothes shop is to the southwest of town, betwixt the jeweler and the Thieves' Guild.;Original
1014203;The Fisher's Guild is the most southern thing in the town, friend.;Original
1014204;The guard tower is south of the Dueling Pit, on the far side of the library.;Original
1014205;The Healer? Why close on to the Dueling Pit, of course!;Original
1014206;The shipwright is nearest the town's eastern docks, but south of the armourer.;Original
1014207;The tailor? That shop is on the southern island. It's a small island, but still Jhelom, right enough.;Original
1014208;The Theater is on the southern isle.;Original
1014209;Thou canst find him to the west of town, past the clothier and the Thieves' Guild.;Original
1014210;Thou wilt find a provisioner on the eastern side of the main town, midway between northmost and southmost.;Original
1014211;Town Hall? Find the Dueling Pits, near the center of town, then head a few paces north and east.;Original
1014212;Town tavern? 'Tis a grand place for ale and perhaps a brawl or two. I recommend it. Head east from the Dueling Pit, and when thou smellest fish, turn right.;Original
1014213;We do have blacksmith shops, one north of the city, just west of Town Hall, and another to the south, near the southern docks.;Original
1014214;We have two. One south of town, and one on the southern isle.;Original
1014215;A fine tavern is located in the southeast section of the city, near the bakery.;Original
1014216;A small island southeast of the main city, is where the council meets in the House of Parliament.;Original
1014217;Above the magic shop located in the southern part of the city, the mage's guild has a lovely meeting hall.;Original
1014218;Artists are rare in Magincia. We import most of our artwork. 'Tis too much work and effort to create it ourselves.;Original
1014219;Magic doth provide a variety of conveniences. But 'tis more a variant of technology than the manipulation of ether, that keeps our houses clean without having to work at it.;Original
1014220;Many a great speech hath been heard in the town square in the north of the city, beside the temple.;Original
1014221;New Magincia? 'Tis nothing wrong with this fine city ... we do not need a new one.;Original
1014222;Parliament doth consist of a nine member council. The retiring council member hath the responsibility of appointing their replacement.;Original
1014223;The bakery is located on the southeastern tip of the main island before you cross the bridge to Parliament.;Original
1014224;The best tailor is located next to the shipwrights on the far southwest side of the city.;Original
1014225;The docks are located on the far south side of the city.;Original
1014226;The fish market is located on the city's docks, on the south side.;Original
1014227;The healer's hall is on the westernmost street in the city, toward the southern end, near the tailor's and the fish market.;Original
1014228;The jeweler's shop is located on the far west side of the city, between the Miner's Guild Hall and the tailor's shop.;Original
1014229;The local inn is located nearly in the exact centre of the city. A small park lies to the north of it.;Original
1014230;The merchants meet in the building behind the fish market. 'Tis near the docks on the south side of the city.;Original
1014231;The miner's guild is located on the western edge of town, behind the inn.;Original
1014232;The people of Magincia are direct descendants of those who forged the world, and one day we will inherit the world, and make our way to the stars and take our place as the rulers of all the lands below. We have good cause to be proud.;Original
1014233;The pirates of Buccaneer's Den resent our wealth, but hath begun to raid less and less often thanks to magical items of protection purchased from Moonglow.;Original
1014234;The provisioner shares space with the fish market. 'Tis located on the city docks on the far south end of the city.;Original
1014235;The shipwrights, why 'tis located on the south side of the city on the docks.;Original
1014236;The temple is located near the beach to the far north, just east of the town square.;Original
1014237;The tinker's shop is located just south of the steps leading toward the town square on the north end of town.;Original
1014238;There's a warehouse that stocks all kinds of goods on the east side of the city near the tinker's shop.;Original
1014239;Thou canst purchase magical goods in the southern end of the city along the central street.;Original
1014240;Both Miners' Guild halls are near the center of town.;Original
1014241;Dancing is a sport in Minoc. Sometimes the music is louder than the blacksmith's anvil next door.;Original
1014242;I do not know of a place called 'Buccaneer's Den'.;Original
1014243;Miners' tents are east and south of town. They stay close to the mines, mostly.;Original
1014244;Minoc is about thee. There is not much north of here, friend.;Original
1014245;Minoc is not so large a city that we must separate the homes from the businesses. Houses are throughout the town.;Original
1014246;Our healer's shop is in the southeastern corner of town.;Original
1014247;Soldiers and professional fighters all gather in their hall, which is near center of town, one door south of the tavern.;Original
1014248;Supplies are a steady business in Minoc. We have a provisioner on both the north and south sides of town.;Original
1014249;The butcher's shop is at the very northwest corner of Minoc.;Original
1014250;The horses are kept a bit apart from the town. The stable is north, just northeast of the tavern.;Original
1014251;The mines are due east of town.;Original
1014252;The tavern is in the north part of town, near to the butcher and warriors' guild.;Original
1014253;The woodworker has a good selection of material in these parts. The shop is on the east side of town, just a bit of wander north of the tanner.;Original
1014254;Thou'lt find our tinker in the center of Minoc.;Original
1014255;Thou'rt lookin' for the blacksmith? The smithy is on the far side of town from the stables.;Original
1014256;We have but one tanner, and thou'lt find the shop south, but not so far as the provisioner.;Original
1014257;We have two guilds: the Warriors' and the Miners'.;Original
1014258;We think pretty highly of our armourer. His shop in the southeast corner of town has brisk business.;Original
1014259;All manner of baked goods can be found just south of the docks.;Original
1014260;Fine armour can be had from the armoury in the center of town. Look to the west of Moonglow, to one side of the street that leads west out of town.;Original
1014261;Fresh fruit can be had at a humble store near the center of town. It is just south of the inn, if thou'rt interested.;Original
1014262;If it were not for the zoo in southern Moonglow, the mages would have to trek into the wilds to view these humble creatures ... and grass stains make for angry apprentices.;Original
1014263;If thou'rt looking for the town hall, look to the southwest corner of the heart of Moonglow.;Original
1014264;Indeed, Moonglow has several Mages' Guilds. Three in fact. One to the south, one to the east and one to the north.;Original
1014265;Master mages are usually professors at the Lycaeum. They can be found there, or in their homes, or sometimes about the streets of Moonglow. They are usually willing to answer questions.;Original
1014266;Moonglow was founded by Lord British to be a research colony. The Lycaeum is where the research takes place. Nearly all new magic in Britain comes from that building on the northwest peninsula.;Original
1014267;North of the Gadgeteers' Guild is a mage scholar who will teach travelers his lore, regardless of whether they attend the Lycaeum.;Original
1014268;Our healer is in the central part of Moonglow, on the far western side. It is but two doors away from the teleporters, and that's a good thing, I promise.;Original
1014269;Our tailor has a central location, just across the street from the provisioner.;Original
1014270;Reagents are quite in demand in Moonglow. There is a store devoted to their sale, close by the teleporters.;Original
1014271;Teleporters? Well, there's one near the Lycaeum, of course, one by the zoo, one near the eastern residence section, and one near the northern houses.;Original
1014272;The artists live near their guildhall. If thou'rt interested in visiting Moonglow's bastion of the finer arts, look to the east of the main town area. The artists are close by where the road turns northward.;Original
1014273;The best place in Moonglow to buy supplies would be at the provisioner's shop, just south of the docks.;Original
1014274;The butcher is across the street from the herbalist. If thou'rt lost, both meat and herbs are to the west of the central teleporters.;Original
1014275;The cemetery is found to the south of the city. It is a small one, but strikingly serene.;Original
1014276;The docks are easy enough to get to ... they are north of the city proper, and in betwixt the two 'prongs' that extend north into the sea.;Original
1014277;The Gadgeteers' Guild is in the heart of the city, to the southeast of the teleporters.;Original
1014278;The herbalist is found but one door south of the shop of reagents. Theirs customers are similar, but their businesses do not conflict as often as thou might suspect.;Original
1014279;The inn is east a ways from the docks, a bit south. If thou sees the Artists' Guild, thou art too far east. If thou finds the scholar mage's place, thou art too far south.;Original
1014280;There is one apprentice for each Mages' Guild. Therefore, one is to be found near the northern Guild, one near the southern Guild, and one to the east.;Original
1014281;Thou canst guess from our city's name that our scholars are intrigued by celestial objects. In the eastern part of the city, near the shore, we have the realms' largest eyeglass pointed at the sky.;Original
1014282;Thou should stop and take a look at the woodcarver's wares. Thou'lt find the store just north and a bit west from the main teleporter location. The skill and detail work are, I think, second to none.;Original
1014283;We are on Verity Isle. The island is named so for the city puts much store in lofty intellectual pursuits.;Original
1014284;We have a mage who deals in potions and other such things. Look a bit south of the tailor, just to the northeast of the teleporters.;Original
1014285;And why wouldst thou be needing a cemetery? Sure, thou'rt neither so old, nor so ill? Well, thou'lt find it to the far northwest, outside the city walls.;Original
1014286;Aye, The Silver Bow. 'Tis a bit quieter than Mystical Spirits, I'll tell that that. 'Tis further from the casino than Mystical Spirits, just south of the concert hall. Draws a milder crowd.;Original
1014287;Dost thou mean the gazebo? The little open-air wooden structure on the southeast side of town? 'Tis between The Silver Bow tavern and Restful Slumber inn.;Original
1014288;If the idea of a human chessboard appeals to thee, thou'lt find ours at the southern end of the road through the center of town, past the town manor and the inn.;Original
1014289;If thou seekst to buy or sell goods, most tradespeople keep shops in the mall at the far west end of town. If thou'rt merely hungry, thou canst get a good meal at The Silver Bow or Mystical Spirits.;Original
1014290;If thou'rt in search of sustenance, thou'lt find two taverns in the east of town - Mystical Spirits and the Silver Bow.;Original
1014291;If thou'rt looking to buy or sell something, there's a mall to the west of the city, where thou'lt find almost everything - blacksmith, boyer, weaponsmith, tanner, food and supplies.;Original
1014292;Needst thou a tailor? Thou canst not find one better than ours ... Thou'lt find the shop along the eastern edge of town, next door to the Mystical Spirits tavern.;Original
1014293;Our inn is called Restful Slumber, and 'tis fairly true to name. Thou'lt find it in the southeastern quarter of town, neighboring The Silver Bow tavern. I wish a pleasant stay.;Original
1014294;Seek'st thou a gaming house? The try the casino in the northeast quarter, next door to the Mystical Spirits. I think thou'lt find Nujel'm lives up to her reputation.;Original
1014295;So, 'tis the merchant's guild thou'lt be seeking? Art interested in trade in human flesh, then? For that's what thou'lt find there. 'Tis at the southern tip of town, next the jail.;Original
1014296;The jeweler's shop is in the northeast corner of town, east of the conservatory and north of the casino.;Original
1014297;There's but one bank in Nujel'm, and it lies in the southeastern quarter of town, not too far from the human chessboard.;Original
1014298;Thou'lt find the customs house overlooking the northeast bay. 'Tis inside the city walls, next door to the concert hall.;Original
1014299;Thou'lt find the jail near the merchant's guild, south of the human chessboard. I'd be wary if I wert thee - 'tis one thing to be on this side of the bars down there, but 'tis a nightmare on the other.;Original
1014300;Thou'lt find the Mystical Spirits on the eastern edge of town, next door to the casino. But if thou permit me to say, I prefer The Silver Bow, which is just a few paces south of it. Better atmosphere.;Original
1014301;Travelers from less civilized towns often mistake the large building in the center of town for a palace. But, 'tis merely a manor house, and the man who lords over it made his fortune here in Nujel'm.;Original
1014302;We have both a renowned conservatory and concert hall. Thou'lt find both to the north of town, between the customs house and the casino.;Original
1014303;Wilt thou hear sweet music? We have a beautiful concert hall in the north of the city, next door to the customs house. There's a conservatory for bards across the street, should you wish to study further.;Original
1014304;All manner of clothing can be found on the mainland side. The tailor's shop is just west from the stables.;Original
1014305;I've been pleased with our armourer's work. Look for the shop called 'Serpent's Arms', just east of the healer.;Original
1014306;Our provisioner can set thee up with supplies. Look just to the north of the blacksmith.;Original
1014307;'Serpent's Hold Meats' is on the shore of the mainland, east of the bridge.;Original
1014308;Serpent's Hold, thou hast found, is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes.;Original
1014309;The blacksmith works in one of the large buildings central in the Hold. The smithy is the northernmost of the two.;Original
1014310;The heart of Serpent's Hold is the Keep. It is the largest building on the island, in the northwest corner.;Original
1014311;The inn is on the west side of the island, close to the main gate.;Original
1014312;The stables are on the mainland side of Serpent's Hold, betwixt the tailor and the tinker.;Original
1014313;The tavern faces the healer's shop, immediately on thy left as thou comes in over the bridge.;Original
1014314;The tinker's place is on the mainland. Thou'lt find it closest to the bridge.;Original
1014315;Thou'lt find the healer's place between the armoury and the tavern. 'Tis sometimes crowded, especially right after training.;Original
1014316;Cartographer's are usually found sharing space with shipwrights.;Original
1014317;Farmers come into town, but their crops are all a bit over on the mainland.;Original
1014318;Just north of the healer is where our blacksmith keeps shop.;Original
1014319;Not settling down, I take it. Thou'lt find the provisioner to the northwest of the inn.;Original
1014320;Our fair city of Skara Brae is the central hub for all the westward sea expeditions.;Original
1014321;Our healer is close to the east dock.;Original
1014322;Our inn is at the south end of the isle, near the docks, o'course.;Original
1014323;Our theatre is on the northern edge of town, just a bit north and east of the beekeeper.;Original
1014324;The alchemist's shop is the very most northeast place in town.;Original
1014325;The animal trainer sets up shop just north of the beekeeper. They are much the same thing, to my mind.;Original
1014326;The armourer is toward the center of town, but off a bit to the north-west.;Original
1014327;The beekeeper has a shop toward the north of town, just south of the theatre.;Original
1014328;The bowyer is north and a little west of the inn. In my opinion, the work is excellent.;Original
1014329;The butcher shop is in the midst of town, betwixt the tavern and the magic shop.;Original
1014330;The clothier keeps his shop on the east shore, three doors north of the dock.;Original
1014331;The rangers' guildhall is on the west side of the isle. 'Tis north of the tavern and Town Hall, y'know.;Original
1014332;The tavern sits on the western shore. It is just north of Town Hall;Original
1014333;There is a shop of gentle magics, and that's a fact. 'Tis very near the exact center of town.;Original
1014334;This is fine country for growing food. Our farmers sell at a shop near the northern edge of town, toward the middle and just south of the theatre.;Original
1014335;Thou hast a choice. There is one guild on the northwest side of town, and another just across the water to the east.;Original
1014336;Town Hall, eh? Well, and I hope thou bring no trouble to our fair isle. Walk west and south to get there.;Original
1014337;Weapons can be had from the shop in the north-east corner of town.;Original
1014338;We've a fine shipwright, close on to the southernmost dock.;Original
1014339;Woodcrafter? That shop is toward the north of town, center between the weaponsmith and the farmers' shop.;Original
1014340;Any thieves or other such riffraff are incarcerated in the Constabulary, just north of the Traveler's Gate.;Original
1014341;Fine gems are the trade of our master jeweler, who has set up shop on the south side of our commercial district, neighboring the baker and the healer.;Original
1014342;If thou hast a mind to see a tinker, the shop is in the southern part of the city ... just follow the river up to where it enters the city, and thou'lt find the place.;Original
1014343;If thou'rt looking for the Fishers' Guild, go to the farthest part of the city to the southeast. The guildhall is next to the fish market.;Original
1014344;Our baker is in the southern part of the city, just to the south and east of the Traveler's Gate.;Original
1014345;Our Engineers' Guild is in the northwest corner of town.;Original
1014346;Our provisioner's shop is the first thing one sees coming into the city. 'Tis the large building to the south of the entrance gate.;Original
1014347;The armour shop is north of the monastery and mayor's house. I think you'll be pleased with the selection.;Original
1014348;The butcher's shop is in the southeast corner of Trinsic.;Original
1014349;The Guild of Engineers meets in their hall in the northwest section of town.;Original
1014350;The mayor lives in the north side of town, betwixt the armourer and the monastery.;Original
1014351;The monastery is renowned for its serene gardens. 'Tis on thy left as thou comes into the city.;Original
1014352;The paladins meet in their guildhall, found on the eastern side of their island.;Original
1014353;The paladins who live in Trinsic call the barracks home. They are in the northern part of the eastern half of town.;Original
1014354;The stables are just a pace to the west of the inn.;Original
1014355;The tailor's shop is a bit apart from the others. It is a bit south and east of the river's fork.;Original
1014356;The tavern is just west of the fork in the river.;Original
1014357;There's a good weaponsmith in the center of town, just a few paces south of the Soldier's Gate.;Original
1014358;There's a guild or two in Trinsic. The Fisher Guild is to the southeast, and the Engineer's Guild is to the northwest. The Paladins' Guild is on their island, of course.;Original
1014359;Thou'rt in Trinsic, of course, near the Cape of Heroes we are.;Original
1014360;Thou'rt looking to train? The training salle is just inside the Soldier's Gate.;Original
1014361;To find the shrine, simply walk to the point most north and east of town. 'Tis close to the water.;Original
1014362;We have a very fine mage indeed. Thou canst find him just north of the inn, above the Traveler's Gate.;Original
1014363;We have but one healer, and too far a walk from the training grounds, to my mind. If thou hast wounds, look to the south of the commercial district.;Original
1014364;We have guardhouses at most strategic locations: especially wall corners with good visibility.;Original
1014365;We have two inns, one at the easternmost part of town, and one in the west, a bit to the north.;Original
1014366;You can't get fish fresher than at our fish market. It is outside the city gates, on the sea side.;Original
1014367;Customs is in the very southeast part of Vesper.;Original
1014368;I can tell thee that our mage buys reagents from the reagent shop near the docks. The stuff comes from all over, and Vesper gets first pick-through.;Original
1014369;I hope thou hast had no trouble in Vesper, friend. The town hall is a southern island, one door south of the warriors' guild.;Original
1014370;If I knew there was a thieves guild, I'd tell the guards first!;Original
1014371;If thou'rt in need of armour, look on the central westernmost island of Vesper.;Original
1014372;If thou'rt looking for potions, the shop thou needest is to the far north of Vesper, on the same island as the Jeweler.;Original
1014373;Lookin' for the Bards' Guild? 'Tis the southernmost building on the northernmost island of Vesper.;Original
1014374;On a lazy afternoon I like to wander around in Vesper's museum. It is the large building east of the tanner.;Original
1014375;On the centermost island, farthest to the east, thou canst find the Seaman's guild.;Original
1014376;On the western shore, at the southern end of Vesper, is an inn. It is much the same as the inn on the south-central island.;Original
1014377;Our bank is on the northmost island. Look for the jeweler and the painter's studio.;Original
1014378;Our healer has trained with the best, friend, as will be more than able to ease thy suffering. Look on a small island, just one bridge east of the blacksmith, or one bridge south of the woodworker.;Original
1014379;Our mortuary and crypts are on the western bank, north of the inn.;Original
1014380;Our tinker's shop can be found on a central island, somewhat north.;Original
1014381;The baker's place is on the island just north of the docks.;Original
1014382;The bee hives are kept on a small islet at the northeast. 'Tis north of the butcher and baker, and east of the painter's studio.;Original
1014383;The best artist's studio, and by coincidence the only one, is on the northern isle, near the guild houses.;Original
1014384;The farmer brings his produce in from the fields and sells it from his shop on the island just north of the docks.;Original
1014385;The jeweler keeps shop on the northern island, betwixt the miners' and bards' guild halls.;Original
1014386;The shipwright is the nearest building to the docks, o'course!;Original
1014387;The soldiers and fighters gather in their hall on the large southern island.;Original
1014388;The tailor is on the eastern shore of the river. Take the bridge from the northern isle and then go south.;Original
1014389;The tanner is one bridge away from shore, at the point farthest south of the city.;Original
1014390;The tavern is on one of the southern islands, I believe toward the center. I see it when I run errands to the customs house.;Original
1014391;The woodworker's shop can be found but one bridge north of the healer's island.;Original
1014392;There are a fair number of sorcerers here, and that's a fact. They meet in the upper floors of their hall on the north island.;Original
1014393;There are mages who will sell their talents, true enough. Merely look on the ground floor of their guildhall on the north island.;Original
1014394;There is naught but fresh fish in Vesper, and 'tis easiest had from the fisherman's shop. Look near the baker and butcher's places.;Original
1014395;There's a fine tailor's shop in Vesper. Look to the largest southern island, in the building just north of the warriors' guildhouse.;Original
1014396;Thou might try one of the center islands, away to the west. Methinks I've seen a bowyer's sign hanging there.;Original
1014397;Thou'lt be wanting supplies, I take it? The provisioner keeps a shop to the north of town, on the shore.;Original
1014398;Thou'lt find the blacksmith on the largest of the southern isles.;Original
1014399;Thou'lt find the Miners' Guildhouse on the northernmost island, just where the river breaks around Vesper.;Original
1014400;Thou'rt looking for the butcher, I take it. Get thee to the docks, then take the bridge north from that island. The butcher is the first building thou'lt see.;Original
1014401;Vesper, thou canst see, is on the eastern coast of Britannia, to the north.;Original
1014402;Food is a necessity, but certainly nothing to waste time over. Our communal eating area is to the far east of Wind.;Original
1014403;If thou needest a healer, look to the eastern central part of wind. 'Tis close by the food place, if thou knowest where that is, but farther south and west.;Original
1014404;Inns are scattered throughout Wind. One is northwest, one is northeast, and one is south.;Original
1014405;Labs are places of study and discovery. We've one to the northwest of Wind, and one to the east.;Original
1014406;Lord British became ruler of the united realm of Britannia when he wrested control from the 'evil' Lord Robert. The stories that are mostly known are, of course, mostly apocryphal.;Original
1014407;Lord British is the ruler of Britannia. He seems a kind and just king, trying to do the right thing for his people.;Original
1014408;Magincia is an island city east of Britain. It is all pride and foolishness, for it has never known deprivation.;Original
1014409;Minoc is in the northmost part of the realm, a bit to the east. It is in the mountains, and is economically dependent on the nearby ore mines.;Original
1014410;Moonglow is on the southern tip of Verity isle, and is a very logical place. They buy other cities' technology and examine it to see how it works. Laudable.;Original
1014411;Our libraries are filled with scholars grazing on information. Look to the center of Wind for our collected tomes of knowledge.;Original
1014412;Our only supply of reagents are sold in the central part of Wind. Look close by the libraries, in the same general location of the healer.;Original
1014413;Serpent's Hold is on the largest island just east and south of the Cape of Heroes. It is where all the fighters of Britannia are trained.;Original
1014414;Skara Brae is on an island due west of Britain. They study a mental form of magic that is unusual for that part of the world.;Original
1014415;Tailor made clothes and repairs thou canst find at the tailor's shop, east of the provisioner.;Original
1014416;This is Wind, of course. We study all manner of things: magic, the world, the inexplicable self.;Original
1014417;Thou canst purchase thy supplies from the provisioner, found south and west from the northwestern inn.;Original
1014418;Yew is in the northwest region of Britannia. It is home to the Empath Abbey where the famous wine is made.;Original
1014419;Fresh meat can be had from the butcher, in the clearing at the center of Yew.;Original
1014420;Fresh vegetables and other nourishing foods are sold at the market in the center of town. Look for a shop close by the butcher and baker.;Original
1014421;If thou hast grain to be milled, take it to the flour mill just a bit west of the Abbey.;Original
1014422;If thou'rt handy with a bow and arrows, then surely thou'lt be interested in our bowyer's excellent work. Look in his shop at the center of town ... there a selection that'll make thy head spin.;Original
1014423;It was decided a long time ago that local judges would sit on the High Court. If thou wishes to see the court, head west and north of town. I cannot say if there is a trial in progress, however.;Original
1014424;The cemetery is to the south and east of town.;Original
1014425;The healers in Yew are specialized in natural cures. There are at least two in town: one is southeast and one is central.;Original
1014426;The monks in the abbey that lies to the northeast spend their time studying painting, sculpting, prose, poetry, music ... and wine.;Original
1014427;The prison is past the High Court to the northwest ... although it is not a common tourist site. Usually people come here for the wine.;Original
1014428;The vineyards and winery are just south of the abbey, to the east of the flour mill and across the little inlet.;Original
1014429;There is a prison storehouse between the High Court and the prison.;Original
1014430;We do have a baker, and a fine one at that. To find the bakery, find the market near the center of Yew. The baker hangs his sign between that of the butcher and the woodworker.;Original
1014431;Yew is famous for its wood crafts. There is a woodwork shop near the bakery, just a bit south of the bowyer.;Original
1014432;Yew, thou hast found, is in the northwest region of Britannia.;Original
1014433;Dost thou need to improve thy alchemy? Sure, I might be able to teach thee.;Original
1014434;I am an alchemist.;Original
1014435;I train animals.;Original
1014436;I am an architect.;Original
1014437;I'm an armourer.;Original
1014438;I've been known to teach some how to improve their skills, for a few coins.;Original
1014439;I am an artist.;Original
1014440;Yes, I'm the baker. How can I help thee?;Original
1014441;I am a Banker.;Original
1014442;I am a bard. A minstrel. A thoughtful troubadour.;Original
1014443;Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.;Original
1014444;If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.;Original
1014445;I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.;Original
1014446;I'm a beekeeper.;Original
1014447;I'm between jobs at the moment. But if thou couldst find it in thine heart to help out a soul in need, I'm sure that my luck will change!;Original
1014448;I've been a smith for a good number of years.;Original
1014449;I'm a bowyer by trade.;Original
1014450;I am sort of like a porter. I lighten the burdens of rich travelers.;Original
1014451;I am a butcher.;Original
1014452;I'm the carpenter here.;Original
1014453;I can give thee some practice in carpentry, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.;Original
1014454;A Cashual is one who has a deep understanding of the practical applications of natural philosophy.;Original
1014455;I can give thee some practice in our art, all thou dost need do is to ask.  And leave me a few coins.;Original
1014456;I'm a cobbler.;Original
1014457;Fare thee well.;Original
1014458;Goodbye, stranger.;Original
1014459;May the rest of thy day be pleasant.;Original
1014460;Thou wishest to speak with me?;Original
1014461;Thou hast mine attention.;Original
1014462;What is it thou wishest?;Original
1014463;I am listening to thee.;Original
1014464;I am a cook and baker.;Original
1014465;I've been known to teach some how to improve their cookin', for a few coins.;Original
1014466;Pardon me?,;Original
1014467;Excuse me?,;Original
1014468;I do not understand.;Original
1014469;I beg thee, do not harm me. I cannot help thee.;Original
1014470;I do not understand thee--I am sure it must be my fault, however.;Original
1014471;Begging thy pardon, but I fail to understand what it is that thou wantest.;Original
1014472;I wish I could answer thee, so that thou wouldst leave me alone.;Original
1014473;Excuse my incomprehension, oh mighty terrorizer of small children, but I did not understand thee, and would find life more pleasant without thy ilk nearby.;Original
1014474;I am sorry, but I do not always understand the utterances of petty criminals.;Original
1014475;Forgive me, but I do not understand.;Original
1014476;Excuse me? Forgive my lack of comprehension.;Original
1014477;If I look perplexed, 'tis because I am.;Original
1014478;Accept my apologies, for my lack of comprehension.;Original
1014479;If 'twere in my capabilities to help thee, I surely would.;Original
1014480;I cannot fathom what 'tis that thou wishest.;Original
1014481;Begging thy pardon, but in my awe at seeing thee actually here before me, I neglected to listen closely to what thou spoke.;Original
1014482;Sadly, I must report that I know nothing of what thou speakest.;Original
1014483;Help me to understand thee, for I know not what thou seekest.;Original
1014484;I am a simple farmer. I raise crops.;Original
1014485;I am paid to fight!,;Original
1014486;I've been known to teach a select few how to improve their fighting, for a few coins.;Original

1014494;Greetings.  What might I do for thee?,;Original
1014495;Greetings.  What might I help thee with?,;Original

1014499;I am a guard.;Original
1014500;I'm a wanderer, and take whatever fortune offers me.;Original
1014501;If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about such things as camping in the wild. Or not being seen when thou dost not WANT to be seen. Thou wouldst need to pay me, thou knowest.;Original
1014502;I am one of the many healers of Britannia. I also sell potions and healing scrolls.;Original
1014503;If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee about first aid. I could teach thee, also, about the human anatomy. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.;Original
1014504;I sell many fragrant dried herbs and flowers.;Original
1014505;If thou dost want to learn, I might be persuaded to teach thee some alchemy skills. Thou wouldst need to pay me, of course.;Original

1014517;I am a mapmaker. Wouldst thou like to learn to make maps? In theory, 'tis simple - find a blank map, go to the spot thou wouldst map, and map it. In practice, of course, this requires a bit of skill ...;Original
1014518;If thou dost need help with thy mapmaking, just ask me to teach thee and if I can, I will.;Original

1014538;I am the realtor for this town. If thou desires a domicile of thy own, I can help thee.;Original
1014539;And hello again. How may I help thee, _Name_?;Original

1014560;I'm the tavernkeeper here.;Original
1014561;Aye. I have been called thief, rogue and rapscallion and some things far worse, as I am sure thou hast been. Let us not say that again for others might hear and recognize us.;Original

1046039;Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.;Original
1046040;Uzeraan says:  Hello! I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan. I have a few tasks for you to perform.;Original
1046041;You have arrived not a moment too soon, stranger.  Terrible things have happened and we need your help!;Original
1046042;This island has been plagued with foul creatures ever since the mysterious dark force began its invasion.;Original
1046043;I know we have just met, but our need is dire and I must ask of you a favor.;Original
1046044;For some time now, our hunters have been disappearing in the forests of this island.;Original
1046045;We believe vile 'Shadow Wisps' are responsible for these disappearances.;Original
1046046;Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.;Original
1046047;Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Shadow Wisps'.;Original
1046048;Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.  He is no doubt eagerly awaiting your return.;Original
1046049;Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.;Original
1046050;Uzeraan gives you a somber look and begins to speak slowly:;Original
1046051;You bring sad news stranger and I fear our men may be lost forever. They will be mourned.;Original
1046052;You, however, have shown great Valor in your battle against the wretched 'Shadow Wisps'. I am pleased.;Original
1046053;For your efforts I have placed a small token of my appreciation in your backpack.;Original
1046054;Unfortunately, I have more disturbing news. We once had an underground cavern that we used for mining ore.;Original
1046055;It seems horrible creatures have been emerging from the caves at night, terrorizing the villagers.;Original
1046056;In their folly, a mob of frightened villagers collapsed the entrance to the mining cave.;Original
1046057;The villagers did not know that I had recently installed a teleporter in the cave.  It was designed to give the workers a quick way to return home from the cave.;Original
1046058;What's worse is that this teleporter only goes one way: Out of the cave, into our village.;Original
1046059;The horrid phantasms still haunt us on a nightly basis using MY teleporter to get here. We have no way to get into the cave!;Original
1046060;Well - there is one way. Let me tell you something of magic travel...;Original
1046061;MAGIC TRAVEL:;Original
1046062;To begin with, you need what is called a recall rune.  Blank recall runes can be purchased at most any magic supply shop.;Original
1046063;Then, you need either in your spellbook, or inscribed on a scroll a 'Mark' spell. 'Tis a spell of the 6th circle.;Original
1046064;You then cast the Mark spell and target the recall rune. This inscribes the rune with the location at which you are standing.;Original
1046065;To instantly return to the location where the rune was marked, you employ the 'Recall' spell.;Original
1046066;This spell is of the 4th circle and you should have little trouble with it.;Original
1046067;Simply cast the Recall spell and target the marked recall rune of the location you wish to travel to.;Original
1046068;There is also another, called 'Gate Travel' which operates on the same principles as the Recall spell.;Original
1046069;Gate Travel allows you to open a magical gate to the location of your marked recall rune. This way, others can travel with you.;Original
1046070;Gate Travel is of the 7th circle however, and you will not be able to weave such intricate magic for a while.;Original
1046071;Now - to get back to the subject at hand.  Whilst I was working in the caves, installing the teleporter, I marked a rune.;Original
1046072;This would, in theory, allow us to travel into the cave to investigate the condition of our mining resources.;Original
1046073;Unfortunately, to cast any spell, one must have the necessary reagents. Reagents that I do not have.;Original
1046074;My supply of Mandrake Root has run dry and so I cannot cast any of the magic travel spells needed to enter the cave.;Original
1046075;I must ask of you to go and gather Mandrake Root for me.  Try the reagent shops if you have money, or find another way if you do not.;Original
1046076;I have no money for reagents to give you at this time, but be assured that I will repay you.;Original
1046077;Please hurry - time is short and so is our supply of fighters to fend off the wicked creatures.;Original
1046078;Uzeraan nods at you with approval and begins to speak:;Original
1046079;Thank you stranger. You are not a moment too soon. For your help I have placed a few scrolls in your pack to aid you.;Original
1046080;Just a few Mark and Recall scrolls for you to try out. I've also given you some blank recall runes.;Original
1046081;Now I can send the few remaining soldiers in to the cave to investigate the state of affairs.;Original
1046082;On second thought, *YOU* would do much better against the wretched wraiths than any of our soldiers.;Original
1046083;Go and gather any other supplies you think you will need and then return here. I will transport you below upon your return.;Original
1046084;I was beginning to think you would not return. I am glad to see that I was mistaken.;Original
1046085;Go now into the caves below and find out what you can about the creatures coming from there.;Original
1046086;Slay 6 of the creatures and gather any information on their weaknesses that you can.;Original
1046087;Remember that there is a teleporter somewhere in the cave that will lead back to the surface.;Original
1046088;Mission Complete.  You have slain the restless souls as instructed. Return to Uzeraan to report.;Original
1046089;Uzeraan looks very disturbed at your report.  After a long silence he speaks to you:;Original
1046090;It seems the caves are lost to us as the restless souls you describe have made it their new home.;Original
1046091;The villagers wanted me to thank you for your help and have given me some items to reward you with.;Original
1046092;I have placed some reagents, a few scrolls and some gold in your pack.;Original
1046093;The issue of the restless souls requires more investigation, but alas, a more pressing matter has surfaced.;Original
1046094;My friend and associate, Aegis The Archmage of Moonglow, has been secretly working on a new spell formula.;Original
1046095;The new spell would easily swing the tides in our favor in the battle against this unknown evil that has befallen us.;Original
1046096;Apparently, many of Aegis' apprentices have been getting abducted in an attempt to force information from them.;Original
1046097;I have just received word from Aegis that one of his most trusted students was taken!;Original
1046098;We must send someone to find the apprentice and free him before he is slain! Time is limited!;Original
1046099;You, dear friend, have proven yourself worthy of such a quest.  I have sent word to Aegis that I will send you to aid him.;Original
1046100;Go and gather any supplies you may need for your journey. Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.;Original
1046101;Excellent. You have returned.  I will transport you to Moonglow now.;Original
1046102;Upon your arrival, follow the path North and you will find Moonglow.;Original
1046103;Aegis runs a reagent shop west of the teleporter park within the Moonglow city walls.;Original
1046104;If you have any trouble finding it, ask other adventurers around you and I am sure someone will aid you.;Original
1046105;Good luck, young mage. I hope you succeed. May the aethers have mercy upon us if you do not.;Original
1046106;You have found Aegis!;Original
1046107;The Archmage's face lights up as he spots you in the doorway.;Original
1046108;Thank the heavens! Uzeraan said he would send someone, but I did not expect you so soon.;Original
1046109;As I am sure Uzeraan has told you, one of my apprentices was abducted.;Original
1046110;’Tis a bad omen, as this was one of the few apprentices who knew of my new spell formulas.;Original
1046111;No doubt the mysterious dark force is behind the abduction of my most valuable student.;Original
1046112;I must ask you to go after the evil undead that abducted my apprentice and return him to safety.;Original
1046113;In their haste to escape, one of the abductors dropped a marked recall rune.;Original
1046114;No doubt it leads to the place where they are holding my young wizard captive.;Original
1046115;I have the rune right here. No?  Maybe in this pocket? No. Well - this is most embarrassing.;Original
1046116;Go and fetch yourself some supplies for the forthcoming battle and I will continue my search for the rune.;Original
1046117;Unfortunately, I have not been able to recover the rune yet. Please return in a few minutes. I will keep looking.;Original
1046118;My ancestors smile upon me. I have found the rune to the prison camp.  With this rune we can find the lost apprentice.;Original
1046119;I will transport you now to the location that was inscribed on this rune. I pray it takes you to my student wizard.;Original
1046120;Slay his captors and release him from his bondage. Take these scrolls with you - they will help.;Original
1046121;They are scrolls with the 'Unlock' spell inscribed upon them.  This spell can be very useful.;Original
1046122;Remember however, that the Unlock spell only unlocks things that were locked using the 'Magic Lock' spell.;Original
1046123;Also keep in mind that not only doors can be locked with the lock spell, but also containers of all sorts.;Original
1046124;Now go. Time is short!  Return here when you have saved my apprentice.;Original
1046125;Quest Complete! You have saved the apprentice.  Return to Aegis and speak with him.;Original
1046126;Aegis smiles at you with a look of great satisfaction.;Original
1046127;Well done young Mage!!!  Stay on the path of virtue and continue your lessons in the arcane arts.;Original
1046128;I foresee that you will become a mighty spell wielder who will gain many honors throughout Britannia.;Original
1046129;I thank you for saving my apprentice and therein saving our cause. I feel a reward is in order.;Original
1046130;Gold is also always welcome I think, so here is a check for 1000 gold. Don't squander it now, ye hear?;Original
1046131;Take this magical wizard's hat. It tends to be rough on the body, but does wonders for the mind.;Original
1046132;I hope we meet again in the future my friend. I am indebted to you always.;Original
1046133;Find Uzeraan.  Uzeraan will explain what you need to do next.;Original
1046134;Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Shadow Wisps'. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.;Original
1046135;Return to Uzeraan and tell him of your findings.;Original
1046136;Find 75 Mandrake roots and return them to Uzeraan. Try checking the local reagent shops.;Original
1046137;Gather supplies for battle and return to Uzeraan when you are ready.;Original
1046138;Venture into the mining cave and slay 6 of the restless souls. Use the teleporter in the cave to return.;Original
1046139;Find the teleporter in the cave and return to Uzeraan.;Original
1046140;Gather any supplies you need and return to Uzeraan when you are ready to leave for Moonglow.;Original
1046141;Find Aegis the Archmage in the city of Moonglow. His shop is west of the teleporter park.;Original
1046142;Explore the town and gather supplies for battle. Return to Aegis when you are ready.;Original
1046143;Check in with Aegis after a while to see if he has recovered the rune to the prison camp.;Original
1046144;Find the prison camp where the abducted apprentice is being held. Slay his oppressors and free him.;Original
1046145;Return to Aegis and tell him you have freed his apprentice.;Original
1046146;Uzeraan lives in his mansion within the city of Haven.  Find him and he will give you instructions on tasks he would like you to do for him.;Original
1046147;Uzeraan explains tasks for you to become a better blacksmith.  He has requested that you find an anvil and forge.;Original
1046148;Uzeraan says: Hello!  I am the grand Conjurer, Uzeraan.  I have a few tasks I'd like you to perform.;Original
1046149;These tasks will help you to become a better blacksmith and make tools to aid your smithing.  The tasks are not pointless, as an army needs the weapons and armor you make.;Original
1046150;First, I would like you to find an anvil and forge.  The anvils and forges can be found on this floor of my mansion.;Original
1046151;Forge a ringmail tunic with your smithy hammer or tongs.  Uzeraan has more information, once you make the ringmail tunic.;Original
1046152;At the forge and anvil, you craft the items of your blacksmithy trade.  To protect yourself, you should craft a ringmail tunic.;Original
1046153;To use an anvil and forge, you must be standing next to them.  An anvil and forge allows you to use tongs or a hammer.;Original
1046154;The tongs or hammer you use are in your backpack or hand. Double-clicking the tongs or hammer should bring up a menu to allow you to blacksmith.;Original
1046155;If you are too far from the anvil and forge, you will not get the menu.  If you do not have enough ingots in your backpack for the item you want to smith, then you will not be able to make it.;Original
1046156;Visit Uzeraan once you have made your ringmail tunic.;Original
1046157;Uzeraan explains why you need the ringmail tunic for protection.  The mountains south of the mansion have ore to mine, but may have a critter or two that are hostile.;Original
1046158;Uzeraan says: Now that you have made a ringmail tunic, you will need more ingots to supply yourself for future armor and weapons you make.  Ingots are made from ore that you mine off of mountains.;Original
1046159;There are mountains to the south of my mansion.  They may be dangerous, so make sure to wear your ringmail tunic before you leave.;Original
1046160;Once you find the mountains, you can mine them with your trusty shovel or pickaxe.;Original
1046161;Once you have completed mining five large iron ore piles from mountains or caves, visit Uzeraan.  There are four types of ore piles, the largest pile smelts for the most ingots.;Original
1046162;To mine ore, you will need to use your shovel or pickaxe on the mountainside or on a cave floor.  Double-clicking the shovel or pickaxe allows you to use the item.  You can then target the mountain or cave floor.;Original
1046163;If an area is out of ore, you will need to hunt further along a mountainside or in a cave for more spots to mine at.  Simply use your digging tool on different areas of the stone until you get some ore.;Original
1046164;Ore comes in varying sizes.  The smaller the pile, the fewer ingots it will make when it is smelted.  You will need five large piles of iron ore to smelt into the ingots you need.;Original
1046165;Uzeraan's forge can be used to smelt ore into iron ingots.  Those ingots can be used to make tools.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ore.;Original
1046166;Smelt ore in town at the forge for iron ingots.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed smelting the ingots.;Original
1046167;Uzeraan says: Now that you have the five piles of ore, you will need to smelt them.  The forge allows you to smelt ore.;Original
1046168;Once you find the forge, double-click the piles of ore and target the red coals of the forge.  The ore will be smelted into ingots, if you are close enough to the forge.;Original
1046169;When you have made the iron ingots, visit Uzeraan and he will instruct you on how to make more pickaxes.;Original
1046170;Make two pickaxes for mining with your tinker kit.  Show Uzeraan a pickaxe by giving it to him.;Original
1046171;Shovels and pickaxes break fairly often while mining.  This means you will need to make pickaxes with the ingots you mine up;Original
1046172;To make a couple of pickaxes, you can use your tinker tools on your ingots.  Select the pickaxe from the tinker menu and it will be made from the ingots you selected.;Original
1046173;You can make these pickaxes anywhere, as long as you have the ingots.  This means if you ever run out of pickaxes while mining a mountainside, you can make more pickaxes right away!;Original
1046174;Make fifty iron ingots for the mansion.  Visit Uzeraan once you have completed making the ingots.;Original
1046175;Uzeraan says:  Now that you know how to keep your pickaxes in good supply and how to make iron ingots, I happen to be in need of a large pile of ingots.;Original
1046176;Please make fifty ingots and bring them to me.  I will buy them from you for five-hundred gold.;Original
1046177;Iron ore piles are heavy.  You will need to lug piles of ore you mine back to the mansion to smelt them into iron ingots.  This may take you a few trips back and forth between the mountains and the forge.;Original
1046178;Once you have completed the ingots, visit me for your payment.;Original
1046179;Uzeraan describes the order deeds the armourers need in Minoc.  Find the moongate at the south-east part of town.  This moongate will take you to a location just outside of Minoc.;Original
1046180;Uzeraan says: You have done very well.  You know how to supply yourself with iron ingots and pickaxes.;Original
1046181;Now, I have a more advanced task for you.  The city armourers of Minoc are in need of weapons and armor.  I have placed their order deeds in your backpack for you to fulfill.;Original
1046182;To get to the city of Minoc, you will need to travel through the moongate.  The moongate is located to the south-east of town, towards the mountains.;Original
1046183;The moongate allows you to travel to far destinations.  Select Trammel and then Minoc and accept the menu and it will whisk you away.  Once there, walk west towards the road.;Original
1046184;Now that you have found the moongate, you should walk into it.  A menu will appear asking where you wish to travel to.;Original
1046185;There are two types of moongates.  Moongates, such as the one you just found, are scattered through the world and offer menus of different locations.;Original
1046186;The other type of moongate does not offer a menu.  It is a moongate that powerful mages may temporarily create to allow themselves and others to pass through them to marked locations.;Original
1046187;If you cannot walk into the moongate, you may double-click it to use it.  If you are too far from the moongate, you cannot use the moongate.;Original
1046188;Besides allowing you to travel between locations, you may use a moongate to go to another facet.  The two facets are Felucca and Trammel.;Original
1046189;The city of Haven is in Trammel.  If you wish to travel back to Haven, you would need to select Trammel before selecting it as the city you wish to visit.;Original
1046190;To visit Minoc, you may visit it in either Trammel or Felucca.  Although, the armourers that need the weapons and armor are in Trammel.;Original
1046191;Select Trammel as the facet you wish to visit and then select Minoc as the city.  ;Original
1046192;The city of Minoc is a city of miners, tinkerers, and jewelers.  Minoc is to the north-northwest.  The mountains are north-east of Minoc.  You need to complete the order deeds in Minoc.;Original
1046193;Minoc is to the north-west of the gate you have just exited from.  There is a road to the west that leads north into town.;Original
1046194;The armourers have two shops in town.  They both have forges and anvils in them that you can use to make the weapons and armor in your order deeds.;Original
1046195;If you pass through town, the mountains are to the north-east of Minoc.  You can use those mountains to mine the ore you need for ingots and blacksmithing.;Original
1046196;The grey order deeds can be double-clicked to open them up and read what the amount and type of items are needed by the armourers.  Forge the items as you did for the ringmail tunic earlier with your blacksmithy hammer.;Original
1046197;Use the combine button in the opened deed window to combine your finished products with the deed.  When you have finished the amount the orders are for, drag the deed onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.;Original
1046198;After the deeds have all been completed, travel through the moongate to Haven and find Uzeraan.;Original
1046199;Once you have completed the deeds, Uzeraan will grant you a reward.;Original
1046200;Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.;Original
1046201;You have requested to cancel your quest.  Once you have cancelled your quest, you cannot start the young player quest again.  Do you wish to cancel your quest?;Original
1046202;Now I can finally return to my family.  Will you go and tell Aegis that I am free and that I did not give away the secret of the new spell.;Original
1046203;I have some unfinished business before I can return home.  Fare thee well kind adventurer.;Original
1046204;Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 35 of each reagent.;Original
1046205;Be sure to take your spellbook and I would also suggest that you have at least 50 of each reagent.;Original
1046206;We believe the vile 'Headless' are responsible for these disappearances.;Original
1046207;Go forth and kill at least 6 of these 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find any evidence of our missing men.;Original
1046208;Well done! You have completed your task of slaying the 'Headless'.;Original
1046209;You however, have shown great valor in your battle against the 'Headless'!;Original
1046210;Well there is *ONE* way - Yes! That is it. Whilst I was installing the teleporter I marked a recall rune in the cave!;Original
1046211;I can use this recall rune to transport you directly into the caverns. Alas, you must find your own way out.;Original
1046212;Go and gather supplies for battle. I suggest you take your weapon, some armor and at least 25 bandages to be safe.;Original
1046213;Return here when you are ready to depart and I will transport you into the caverns below the island.;Original
1046214;It's a treasure map I received from a dragon tamer a long time ago. I have neither the time nor the patience to find the treasure.;Original
1046215;Take the treasure map and this shovel.  Double click the treasure map, located in your pack, to see where the treasure is. X marks the spot.;Original
1046216;I can teleport you close to where the treasure should be buried;Original
1046217;It's North from here;Original
1046218;It's North-East from here;Original
1046219;It's East from here;Original
1046220;It's South-East from there;Original
1046221;It's South from here;Original
1046222;It's South-West from here;Original
1046223;It's West from here;Original
1046224;It's North-West from here;Original
1046225;* the magic fails *;Original
1046226;an enchanted sextant;Original
1046227;I'm sorry but it seems your backpack is too full to accept your reward. Come back when you have room for it.;Original
1046228;To show me a pickaxe you have made, drag the pickaxe onto me and I will review your crafted pickaxe.;Original
1046229;Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple of points.;Original
1046230;You need to clear some space in your backpack to continue with the quest.  Visit Uzeraan when you have more space in your backpack.;Original
1046231;The treasure should be here on this island somewhere. I've also given you an enchanted sextant that will help you find your way.;Original
1046232;You're standing right on top of the spot!;Original
1046233;Press ALT-R to bring up your overhead map.  Then you can double click the enchanted sextant to tell you the way.;Original
1046234;Take heed though, the magic of the sextant will only work for you. Don't give it away!;Original
1046235;Once you have found the spot, you will need to follow these steps to bring up the treasure:;Original
1046236;1. Double click your shovel;Original
1046237;2. Target the Treasure map;Original
1046238;3. Target the spot on the ground where the treasure is buried;Original
1046239;If you are digging in the right spot, the chest will emerge, and the treasure's guardians will emerge.;Original
1046240;You must slay all of the guardians before you can open the treasure chest.  Return here after you have completed the treasure hunt.;Original
1046241;You have done well against the guardians of the treasure!  I feel I can entrust you with yet another quest.;Original
1046242;We once used one of the caves below the island for mining purposes.;Original
1046243;Return here when you are ready to depart for Moonglow.;Original
1046244;Good luck, young fighter! I hope you succeed!  May the aethers have mercy on us if you do not.;Original
1046245;Gather your weapon, armor and I suggest at least 30 bandages before you return.;Original
1046246;Come back here after you have made the necessary arrangements and I will teleport you - providing I find the blasted rune.;Original
1046247;Slay his captors and free him!  May your road to glory be paved with the blood of our oppressors.  Go now.;Original
1046248;Well done young fighter! Stay on the path of virtue and glory and honor will be yours.;Original
1046249;I foresee that you will become a mighty warrior.  I see fortune and glory on your path!;Original
1046250;Take this magical sword.  It is a mighty fine weapon.  It will serve you well in your conquest against evil.;Original
1046251;Go forth and kill at least 6 of the 'Headless' creatures. See if you can find evidence of our missing men.;Original
1046252;Find and dig up the treasure.  Slay the guardians and take the booty that is rightfully yours.;Original
1046253;Quest Complete!  You have found the treasure and have slain the guardians. Return to Uzeraan.;Original
1046254;You have excavated the treasure. Return to Uzeraan.;Original
1046255;I've given you a bag with some black, night sight potions. Drink them to see in the dark.  I've also included a few heal potions.;Original
1046256;I have placed some bandages and heal potions in your pack, compliments of the villagers.;Original
1046257;Are you sure you want to release your pet?;Original
1046258;Your quest is complete.;Original
1046259;Haven;Original
1046260;You need to clear some space in your inventory to continue with the quest.  Come back here when you have more space in your inventory.;Original
1046261;That's not enough my friend.  I need 75.  No less.;Original
1046262;I can unfortunately not travel with you, but I have something that will help you find your way.;Original
1046263;Take this enchanted sextant to help guide you on your journey back. Double click the sextant to show you the way to the nearest Moongate.;Original
1046264;Once you find a Moongate, step into it and choose Moonglow as your destination.;Original
1046265;The sextant refuses to be picked up by you;Original
1046266;What misfortunes have befallen you that you would return without completing your task?;Original
1046267;I have adjusted the magical teleporter to take you back.  Step onto the teleporter when you are ready.;Original
1046268;Unfortunately, evil mages have relocated the prisoner to another camp.  Aegis has information on their whereabouts.;Original
1046269;Seek out Aegis in Moonglow and see if he can transport you to the new location of his captured apprentice.;Original
1046270;I have made the necessary adjustments to the Teleporter here. Step on to it when you are ready to depart.;Original
1046271;On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Shadow Wisp' in the cage near the water fountain.;Original
1046272;However, be sure to not attack the monsters in the cage as they are currently under the protection of the town guards.;Original
1046273;You can find out if a creature is attackable or not by the color of their name when you look at them (single click).;Original
1046274;If the name is in blue, then you may not attack them without becoming a criminal.;Original
1046275;Needless to say, becoming a criminal in town will most certainly be detrimental to your health.;Original
1046276;The monsters that you will encounter outside of this mansion, however will highlight grey, which means you can freely attack them.;Original
1046277;Now please go. Time is short, dear friend.;Original
1046278;On your way out, be sure to take a look at the 'Headless' in the cage near the water fountain;Original
1046279;Please also note the blacksmith standing next to the magic teleporter. He sells armor and weapons.;Original
1046280;It may be wise to purchase some equipment from him.  I would suggest armor made of ringmail and perhaps a shield.;Original
1046281;Don't spend all your money on armor though, as you will no doubt at some time wish to purchase bolts of cloth for bandages.;Original
1046282;Cloth can be purchased from tailors and can be cut up with scissors to create bandages.;Original
1046283;Use bandages on yourself (double click bandages and target yourself) any time your hit points get too low.;Original
1046284;Bandages are very cost-effective. Of course, you could also drink a healing potion (yellow) to heal your damage.;Original
1046285;Potions, however, can be costly and require a free hand to drink.  Purchasing any of these items is easy.;Original
1046286;Simply walk up to the appropriate vendor and say the words 'Vendor Buy', or use the vendor's context menu.;Original
1046287;You have died.;Original
1046288;As a ghost you cannot interact with the world. You cannot touch items nor can you use them.;Original
1046289;You can pass through doors as though they do not exist.  However, you cannot pass through walls.;Original
1046290;No one can understand what you say whilst you are dead, unless they are using the 'Spirit Speak' skill to understand your words.;Original
1046291;Since you are a new player, any items you had on your person at the time of your death will be in your backpack upon resurrection.;Original
1046292;To be resurrected you must find a healer in town or wandering in the wilderness.  Some powerful players may also be able to resurrect you.;Original
1046293;While you are still in young status, you will be transported to the nearest healer (along with your items) at the time of your death.;Original
1046294;To rejoin the world of the living simply walk near one of the NPC healers, and they will resurrect you as long as you are not marked as a criminal.;Original
1046295;Target the book you wish to copy.;Original
1046296;That is not a book;Original
1046297;You may not loot this mongbat. Find the one that took your gold.;Original
1046298;This mongbat does not have your gold. You need to find the mongbat that highlights grey.;Original
1046299;No one is allowed to enter this cave from here.;Original
1046300;This yellow potion needs to be in your backpack before you may use it.;Original
1046301;<BODY><BASEFONT COLOR=#DFDFC0>Um... er... greetings. I... um... had some gold that I was supposed to give you... gold courtesy of Uzeraan, who's a mage you'll meet later.</BASEFONT></BODY>;Original

1046355;Large ore:;Original
1046356;If you are leaving the mansion, you should learn about the Radar Map.;Original
1046357;The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.;Original
1046358;Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little.  The map shows you your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.;Original
1046359;You can close the map by right clicking on it.  Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.;Original
1046360;Why are you giving me this?  You need to make pickaxes!;Original
1046361;You have not made two pickaxes.  Come back and show me your work when you have both completed.;Original
1046362;Yes;Original
1046363;No;Original
1046364;Remember that context menus can be called up by single left clicking something (or shift-left click if you have changed the option).;Original
1046365;After you have indicated to the vendor that you wish to purchase something, you will be shown a list of the goods they have to offer.;Original
1046366;Speaking of context menus, you can bring up the status of your quest by bringing up your avatar's own context menu (single left, or shift-left click yourself).;Original
1046367;Choose the 'Quest Log' option, and any information pertinent to your current quest status will be shown to you.;Original
1046368;To help you find the location of the treasure, you should become familiar with the Radar Map.;Original
1046369;The teleporter to the caves is against the north wall of this room.;Original
1046370;May good luck and fortune guide your way.;Original
1046371;Once you emerge from the Moongate, the city will be roughly to the north.  It should not be difficult to find.  Find Aegis and speak with him once you are in the city..;Original
1046372;Actually, before you can spend this money, you will have to take the check to a bank and cash it.;Original
1046373;NPC shop keepers do not accept checks as payment.  Checks are a handy way to transport large sums of money without having to lug all that gold around.;Original
1046374;Cashing a check is very easy.  All you have to do is locate a NPC Banker or Minter, walk near them and say the word 'Bank'.;Original
1046375;Place the check into your bank box and double click it to cash it.  Bankers and Minters can be found inside of banks across the world.;Original
1046376;There is a bank not too far from here, Southeast of this shop, actually.  Banks are often crowded with people conducting business.;Original
1046377;Go now to cash your check.  The person cashing your check will explain the details of Britannia's banking system to you.;Original
1046378;Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.;Original
1046379;To open your bank box, you must be near a Banker or Minter and say the word 'Bank'.;Original
1046380;Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.;Original
1046381;Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place in to a bank box anywhere, can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.;Original
1046382;That is to say, your bank box, along with any goods you placed into it,  is accessible from any bank in the land.;Original
1046383;The safest place for any of your goods, is your bank box.  No one can access it except for you.;Original
1046384;That's pretty much all there is to banking.  I bet you are eager to explore the world, so I won't hold you up any longer.;Original
1046385;I've no tasks for you to complete, and you are free to adventure in the world on your own.;Original
1046386;May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.  We shall no doubt see each other again.;Original
1046387;Farewell.;Original
1046388;Locate the bank and find the NPC Banker (or Minter) inside.  Then, say the word 'Bank' and place your check into your bank box and double click it.;Original
1046389;To make it easier to find the Treasure, be sure to use your radar map.;Original
1046390;To make your attack, you will most likely wish to use your magical powers, so allow me to give you a brief explanation of magic.;Original
1046391;Most often, spells start out as scrolls written by either NPC or Player scribes.  Once a spell has been successfully scribed, you have two choices:;Original
1046392;One: You can cast the spell by using (double click) the scroll.  No spell reagents (ingredients) are required to cast spells from scrolls. Casting from a scroll consumes the scroll.;Original
1046393;Two: You can drop the scroll on to your spellbook where it will be permanently written.  You can then cast the spell from your spellbook any time you wish.;Original
1046394;To cast a spell from a spellbook, the necessary reagents are required (listed with the spell in your spellbook). ;Original
1046395;Casting spells from a spellbook AND casting spells from scrolls requires a certain amount of mana. The actual amount of mana required differs from circle to circle.;Original
1046396;The 1st circle of spells is the easiest of spells to cast (and also has the least mana requirement) whilst 8th circle spells are difficult even for a Grandmaster Mage.;Original
1046397;To actually cast a spell from your spellbook, you must first open your spellbook (double click).  This opens the book to the 1st & 2nd circle spells.;Original
1046398;You can turn pages by single clicking the corner in the top right hand side of the spellbook, or you can single click on the circled numbers on the bottom to jump to specific circle.;Original
1046399;You can double click any of the spell names to make an attempt at casting that spell.  To see a spell's reagent requirements, single click on the spell name.;Original
1046400;Single clicking on a spell name will give you all the details of the spell.  You can see the aforementioned reagent requirements as well as the spell's icon.;Original
1046401;Another way of casting a spell is to click on that spell's spell icon.  You can drag any spell's icon off of the book and place it anywhere in the game window.;Original
1046402;Once a spell icon is in the game window, it will stay there even if you close the spellbook.  This is an easy way to set up many spells for quick casting.;Original
1046403;Before going into battle, you should always check your reagent supply and make sure you have your spell icons set up.;Original
1046404;You now have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.;Original
1046405;You have enough Mandrake in your pack to complete your task for Uzeraan.  Find Uzeraan and give him 75 mandrake roots by dragging them onto him.;Original
1046406;I have drawn you a picture of what the Reagent Shop sign looks like (left).   Remember that you can also look at (single click) shop signs to read them.;Original
1046407;Marking runes is easy.  I'll give you a quick explanation of how it works, then I would advise that you mark a rune somewhere around my mansion so you can return quickly.;Original
1046408;To mark a rune, you must stand in the place where you wish to appear when casting the 'Recall' or 'Gate' spell.;Original
1046409;Then you cast the mark spell (either from a scroll or your spellbook, as I have explained earlier).  Once the spell is cast you will get a targeting cursor.;Original
1046410;Target the rune you wish to mark and single click it.  If your spell is successful, the rune will sparkle and will from then on be 'marked'.;Original
1046411;Looking at the rune (single click) will give you the description of the rune.  If you wish to change the default description, simply double click the rune.;Original
1046412;Once you have double clicked the rune, you will get a text prompt.  Enter the new description and press the [enter] key on your keyboard.;Original
1046413;By naming all of your runes to something that is meaningful to you, you can keep your rune library organized and easy to use.;Original

1046416;During combat it is important to keep an eye on your hit points.  Should they ever drop below 0, you will die.;Original
1046417;To bring up your status bar, single click yourself and drag away from your avatar.  Double click the status bar to see details.;Original
1046418;If your health drops too low, you should heal yourself with bandages or healing potions.  Heal yourself often, and you should have no trouble surviving.;Original
1046419;One more thing before you depart for battle:;Original
1046420;You have found a Moongate.  Remember to choose 'Moonglow' as your destination when you step into the gate.;Original
1046421;Moonglow is where Aegis is waiting for you in his shop.;Original
1046422;Congratulations! You've completed all of your quests!;Original
1046423;I can open a Moongate for you from here to an area close to the Moongate that can take you to the city of Moonglow.;Original
1046424;I only have runes marked for near the Moongate, but the sextant will help you find the rest of the way.;Original
1046425;Aegis' Shop;Original
1046426;I have drawn you a picture to the left of what the sign on Aegis' Shop looks like. It should help you find it a little easier.;Original
1046427;You do not have enough reagents to safely go on.  You should acquire at least 35 of each reagent.;Original
1046428;There are 8 types of reagent: Mandrake, Nightshade, Black Pearl, Sulfurous Ash, Spider's Silk, Garlic, Ginseng and Bloodmoss.;Original

1048052;Double click the grey order deeds to open them.  Once open, the deed lists which items and what quantity the armourer needs.  Once you forge an item, combine the item with the deed by choosing ‘Combine Item’ and targeting the item.;Original
1048053;You can't stable that!;Original
1048054;Uzeraan explains the bank is on the north side of town.  Take your bank check to a banker and drop it on the banker to cash it in.;Original
1048055;Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  I got word through magical means that you had completed your task.  The armourers were extremely happy to have received their orders fulfilled.;Original
1048056;Through my magic, I was able to raise your blacksmithy skill a couple points.  Now, I would like to let you take some time to put your goods in the bank. The bank is right next to the mansion to the southeast.;Original
1048057;As you approach the bank, the names of bankers and their titles of 'banker' or 'minter' will appear.  This means you have located the building where you can access your bank account.;Original
1048058;How to open your bank account by saying the word 'bank' and depositing items.  Once finished, visit Uzeraan and he will give you a pack horse.;Original
1048059;Ah! Thank you noble adventurer!  I have accepted your check and cashed it for you.  The cash can be found in your bank box.;Original
1048060;Of course you can also open your bank box by using a Minter's or Banker's context menu.;Original
1048061;Bank boxes in Britannia are special in that the goods you place into a bank box anywhere can be accessed from your bank box anywhere else in the land.;Original
1048062;The safest place for any of your goods is your bank box.  No one can access your bank box except for you.;Original
1048063;After you have finished depositing items in your bank, visit Uzeraan for a pack horse.;Original
1048064;Uzeraan explains how to use a pack horse.  Take your pack horse to mountains south of Uzeraan's castle.;Original
1048065;Pack horses are used to carry large quantities of items that you normally could not fit in your backpack.  Miners use them for carrying large quantities of ore, ingots, and some tools.;Original
1048066;Pack horses are loyal to their masters unless they are not fed.  Apples or pears are foods that the pack horses appreciate and will keep them loyal.;Original
1048067;Once you have renamed your pack horse, you can have your pet obey commands.  The most common commands are 'follow me' and 'stay'.  However, your pet must be in range to hear you.;Original
1048068;All pets you own can be renamed.  Click and hold the left mouse button on the pack horse and drag its health bar.;Original
1048069;Try walking away from your pack horse and tell it to follow you by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'follow'.;Original
1048070;To get your pet to stay, you would tell it to stay by left-clicking on the pack horse and select the command 'stay' from the command list.;Original
1048071;Mine 40 piles of ore from the mountains and use your pack horse to haul the piles of ore.  Visit Uzeraan at his mansion once you have the 40 piles of ore.;Original
1048072;Now that you know how to handle your pack horse, use your new pack horse to haul 40 large piles of ore from the mountains.  You will need to tinker a couple more shovels to be able to mine the ore.;Original
1048073;You can double-click on your pack horse to open its backpack.  While open, you can load your pack horse by dropping items into its backpack.;Original
1048074;Uzeraan encourages you to practice to 70 skill in blacksmithy.  You do not have to train immediately.  When you have reached 70 skill, visit Uzeraan.;Original
1048075;Uzeraan says: Congratulations!  You have mastered the basics of mining and blacksmithy.  I am giving you 500 gold for your ore.  You may keep your pack horse.;Original
1048076;Now that you have accomplished so much, you should train your blacksmithy skill so you may perform a more difficult task.  It may take some time to train to 70 skill.  I have a task to ask of you when you have finished training.;Original
1048077;You do not need to hurry out and train.  The world is waiting to be explored and some adventurers may need your skills.  Come visit me when you have trained to 70 skill (or higher).;Original
1048078;Now that you are an accomplished blacksmith, Uzeraan has another set of orders the armourers of Minoc would like you to fulfill.  Once completed, give them to an armourer or blacksmith in the city of Minoc.;Original
1048079;Uzeraan says: Ah, I see that you are well on your way to mastering blacksmithy.  I have four order deeds that the armourers would like you to fulfill in Minoc.;Original
1048080;One of the deeds is the large order, which must be combined to completed order deeds.  The three smaller deeds are for chainmail.;Original
1048081;Combine the items requested in the order with the small deed.  Once the deed is completed, you can use the large order deed to combine with a smaller deed.;Original
1048082;The large order deed, when it is filled with all of the small deeds, would then be dropped onto an armourer or blacksmith in Minoc.  They will make sure your goods go to those in need.;Original
1048083;Visit Uzeraan once you have completed the orders for the armourers of Minoc.;Original
1048084;Mastering blacksmithy;Original
1048085;Now that you have helped the blacksmiths of Minoc, you have proved your worthiness of mastering blacksmithy.;Original
1048086;When you have reached 100 skill in blacksmithy, you will have the ability to mark your crafted items with your name.;Original
1048087;Folk from around the world of Britannia can wear your signed armor and wield your signature weapons when you are a grandmaster blacksmith.;Original
1048088;You have just slain your first 'Headless'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself, if need be.;Original
1048089;To check your health, single left-click + drag away from your avatar. This brings up your status bar. ;Original
1048090;Double click the status bar to see detailed information. Check your hitpoints and determine if you would like to heal yourself at this point or not. ;Original
1048091;To heal yourself you may use bandages (double click bandages and target yourself) or drink a heal potion (free one of your hands and double click the potion).;Original
1048092;Alternatively, if you know your way around spellbooks and such, you can cast the Heal or Greater Heal spells to recover lost hitpoints.;Original
1048093;You have slain the leader of the pack.;Original
1048094;Be sure to check his corpse (double click) for the red box which holds the key to the cage in which the apprentice is being held.;Original
1048095;Cast the Unlock spell on the red box to open the lock.;Original
1048096;Open (double click) the red box and find the key inside. Take the key (drag and drop into your pack).;Original
1048097;Use the key (double click) and target the door on the prison cage. This will unlock the door.;Original
1048098;Now you can open the door (double click) to free the apprentice.;Original
1048099;You have just slain your first 'Shadow Wisp'. Now is a good time to check your health and heal yourself if need be.;Original

1048101;The Leader Lies Dead;Original
1048102;You should have a bank check in your backpack (a yellow check).  Speak the word 'bank' to open your bank box, drag your bank check into the box, and double-click it to cash it in.;Original
1048103;Visit Uzeraan after you have loaded 40 large piles of ore onto your pack horse.;Original
1048104;To feed your pack horse, you would drag one apple or pear onto your pack horse.  A good practice is to feed your pack horse once an hour.;Original
1048105;Click on the name on the health bar, delete its current name and type in a new name like 'Ed' or 'Trigger' (without spaces in the name).;Original
1048106;The pack horse should whinny and walk towards you (unless it is not well fed), after you target yourself with the target cursor.;Original
1048107;If the list has not ever displayed, try holding the shift key and left-clicking on the pack horse.  Take your pack horse south to the mountains to receive further instructions.;Original

1049321;Find the High Mage <I>Schmendrick</I> in the mines and recover the scroll of power from him.;Original
1049322;<I>Schmendrick barely pays you any attention as you approach him.  His mind seems to be occupied with something else.  You explain to him that you came for the scroll of power and after a long while he begins to speak, but apparently still not giving you his full attention...</I><BR><BR>Hmmm.. peculiar indeed.  Very strange activity here indeed... I wonder...<BR><BR>Hmmm.  Oh yes! Scroll, you say?  I don't have it, sorry. My apprentice was carrying it, and he ran off to somewhere in this cave.  Find him and you will find the scroll.<BR><BR>Be sure to bring the scroll to Uzeraan once you have it. He's the only person aside from myself who can read the ancient markings on the scroll.  I need to figure out what's going on down here before I can leave.  Strange activity indeed...<BR><BR><I>Schmendrick goes back to his work and you seem to completely fade from his awareness...;Original
1049323;Find Schmendrick's apprentice who is somewhere in the mining cave.  The apprentice has the scroll of power needed by Uzeraan.;Original
1049324;You have obtained the scroll of power!  Find your way out of the cave.<BR><BR>Hand the scroll to Uzeraan (drag and drop) once you arrive in his mansion.;Original
1049325;<I>Uzeraan carefully unravels the scroll and begins to read...after a short while his face lights up with a smile and he speaks to you...</I><BR><BR>This is wonderful, friend!  For your troubles I've given you a treasure map I had laying about, along with a shovel to <a href = "?ForceTopic91">dig up the treasure</a>.  Feel free to find the treasure at your leisure.<BR><BR>Now let us get back to the business of this scroll. The only trouble, is that this scroll calls for some special ingredients that I do not have on hand.<BR><BR>Though it may involve some danger, I will ask of you to find these reagents for me.  <BR><BR>There are three reagents I need to complete the spell.<BR><BR>The first thing I need is some <I>Fertile Dirt</I>.<BR><BR>There lives a Dryad on this island who I know would have such a thing on hand.  I have recalibrated the teleporter to transport you to the Dryad's grove, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-West</a> of this mansion.<BR><BR>Tell her Uzeraan sent you, and she should cooperate.<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry.  I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>.  Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this mansion.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me or any of my mansion guards the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.;Original
1049326;<I>The Dryad watches hungrily as you approach, giving you an uneasy feeling in the pit of your stomach.  You explain that Uzeraan has sent you for a quantity of fertile dirt.  With a wide grin and in a slightly hoarse voice she replies...</I><BR><BR><I>Fertile Dirt</I>, eh?  Well, I have a few patches here...but what have you brought me in return?  Came empty-handed did you?  That's unfortunate indeed... but since you were sent by my dear friend Uzeraan, I supposed I could oblige you.<BR><BR><I>The Dryad digs around in the ground and hands you a patch of Fertile Dirt.<BR><BR>With a smile she goes back to her work...</I>;Original
1049327;You have acquired the <I>Fertile Dirt</I>!<BR><BR>Return to the mansion (<a href = "?ForceTopic13">North-East</a> of the Dryad's Grove) and hand it to Uzeraan.;Original
1049328;NullString.;Original
1049329;<I>Uzeraan takes the dirt from you and smiles...<BR><BR></I>Wonderful!  I knew I could count on you.  As a token of my appreciation I've given you a bag with some bandages as well as some healing potions.  They should help out a bit.<BR><BR>The next item I need is a <I>Vial of Blood</I>.  I know it seems strange, but that's what the formula asks for.  I have some locked away in a chest not far from here.  It's only a short distance from the mansion.  Let me give you directions...<BR><BR>Exit the front door to the East.  Then follow the path to the North.  You will pass by several pedestals with lanterns on them.  Continue on this path until you run into a small hut.  Walk up the stairs and through the door.  Inside you will find a chest.  Open it and bring me a <I>Vial of Blood</I> from inside the chest.  It's very easy to find.  Just follow the road and you can't miss it.<BR><BR>Good luck!;Original
1049330;You have been ambushed! Fight for your honor!!!;Original
1049331;You take a vial of blood from the chest and put it in your pack.;Original
1049332;You have the vial of blood!<BR><BR>Return to Uzeraan's mansion and hand him the vial.;Original
1049333;<I>You hand Uzeraan the Vial of Blood, which he hastily accepts...</I><BR><BR>Excellent work!  Only one reagent remains and the spell is complete!  The final requirement is a <I>Daemon Bone</I>, which will not be as easily acquired as the previous two components.<BR><BR>There is a haunted graveyard on this island, which is the home to many undead creatures.   Dispose of the undead as you see fit.  Be sure to search their remains after you have smitten them, to check for a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.  I'm quite sure that you will find what we seek, if you are thorough enough with your extermination.<BR><BR>Take this magical silver sword to aid you in your battle.  Silver weapons will damage the undead twice as much as your regular weapon.<BR><BR>Return here when you have found a <I>Daemon Bone</I>.;Original
1049334;Head <a href = "?ForceTopic13">East</a> of here (or use the Horn of Retreat) to return to Uzeraan's Mansion and deliver the bone to Uzeraan.;Original
1049335;<I>As you hand Uzeraan the final reagent, he nods at you with approval and starts searching through the pockets of his robe...<BR><BR>After a short while he hands you a small pouch...</I><BR><BR>There you are.  Your contract of employment with me has expired and so here is your pay.  2000 gold in the form of a check and a magical sextant that will help you find <a href = "?ForceTopic47">Moongates</a> and Banks.<BR><BR>Before you can actually spend the money I have given you, however, you must <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a>.<BR><BR>I have recalibrated the teleporter to take you to the Haven <a href="?ForceTopic38">Bank</a>.  Step onto the teleporter to be taken to the bank, which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of here.<BR><BR>Thank you for all your help friend.  I hope we shall meet each other again in the future.<BR><BR>Farewell.;Original
1049336;Locate the Haven Bank (use the teleporter in Uzeraan's Mansion if necessary), which lies <a href = "?ForceTopic13">South-East</a> of Uzeraan's Mansion.  Once there, <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash your check</a>.;Original
1049337;<I>The banker smiles at you and greets you in a loud and robust voice...</I><BR><BR>Well hello there adventurer!  I see you've learned how to cash checks.  Wonderful!  Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land.  For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Haven, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Britain or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure.  So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself.  Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia!  We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow!  May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.;Original

1049431;Checks are an easy and safe way to transport large sums of cash about without having to carry all that heavy gold on your person.  As an additional bonus, bank checks are <a href = "?84">"blessed"</a>.  As a drawback, checks can not be directly spent on goods that you purchase from <a href = "?33">Shopkeepers</a> or <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.  To spend money from a check, you must first cash it.<BR><BR><U>Cashing a check</U><BR><BR>To cash a bank check, you must first find any bank (locations available in every major city), and <a href = "?38">open your bank box</a>.  Once your bank box is open, drag and drop the check into the bank box.  Once the check is inside of your bank box, simply double click the check to cash it.  The cash will be automatically deposited into your bank box.;Original
1049432;Blessed Items;Original
1049433;Most blessed items can normally be identified by the "[blessed]" tag that displays above the item when looking at (single clicking) it.  A blessed item can not be stolen and will stay with your avatar, even through death.  The blessed item will be located in your backpack upon resurrection.;Original
1049434;Cursed Items;Original
1049435;Cursed items are the opposite of <a href ="?84">blessed</a> items.  Cursed items can be identified by the "[cursed]" tag it displays when looking at (single clicking) it.<BR><BR>Cursed items will <I>always</I> drop to your corpse when you die.

1049438;These scrolls, when used,  will allow you to permanently raise the maximum skill value, in a given skill, beyond 100.0 (up to 120.0). They can be found for various skills and will give varied skill max bonuses (+5, +10, +15, +20).

1049439;Player Protection;Original
1049440;A player who has attained at least Level One (1) in the Justice Virtue may chose to "protect" another player.  This protection can take the form of anything the protector and the protectee agree upon.  Either party may chose to cancel the agreement at any time, via a <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the protectee.  Each player may only be protected by one (1) player, although a protector can protect as many persons as they chose.<BR><BR><U>How does the protector benefit from this?</U><BR><BR>When a protectee acquires a <a href = "?89">Scroll of Power</a>, the protector will automatically also receive a Scroll of Power.

1049441;Context Menus;Original
1049442;Context Menus are menus that are available by single left-clicking (or Shift + single left-click, see below) on most objects or NPCs in the world.  Nearly everything, including your own avatar will have context menus available.<BR><BR>If an object in the world has a context menu available, it will by default appear when you single-left click something.

1049549;Youthful Treasuremaps;Original
1049550;Treasure maps are pieces of paper that will show the location of a buried treasure somewhere in the land.<BR><BR>To find this treasure, a few simple steps must be followed.<BR><BR><U>1.</U> Use the <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map to decode the map. Once a map is decoded, it will no longer have the word "tattered" in it's title.  This is a handy thing to know if you want to find out if a map has been previously decoded or not.  This is important, since only the person that decoded the map, can actually dig up the treasure.<BR><BR><U>2.</U> Finding the treasure is a rather simple procedure on youthful treasuremaps.  You will need some sort of digging device (like a shovel or a pickaxe) to unearth the treasure.  Once you have secured your tools, you will need to open the map (double click) and take a look at it.  Use your <a href = "?14">Radar Map</a> to see if you can somewhat figure out where the treasure might be by comparing the drawing on the map and the picture from the the overhead Radar.<BR><BR>If you are having trouble making out the area,  the best thing to do is to find a patch of grass or dirt (out in the woods perhaps), and start digging.  Digging is easily accomplished by using the "Dig for Treasure" <a href = "?90">context menu</a> on the map.<BR><BR>Once you select the digging option, target the place on the ground that you wish to dig at.  If you are not at the correct spot, you will get help message telling you which direction to move in.  Follow the directions and keep digging until you find the chest.<BR><BR><U>3.</U> Once the chest has emerged, the treasure's guardians will appear.  You must defeat all of the treasure's guardians before you can loot the chest.<BR><BR>Good luck.;Original
1049551;The Nightsight Spell;Original
1049552;The Nightsight Spell is a 1st circle spell, and can be cast by nearly everyone.

1049553;Travel Spells;Original

1049555;The Mark Spell;Original
1049556;The Mark Spell is a sixth (6th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any rune (which can be <a href = "?33">purchased</a> from most magic shops) to <i>mark</i> that rune with your current location.  If the spell is successful, the rune will be permanently marked.  You can mark over an already marked rune, which replaces your new location with the old location.<BR><BR>Once a rune is marked, you can use either the <a href = "?94">Recall</a> or the <a href = "?96">Gate</a> spell to travel back to the marked location, instantaneously.;Original
1049557;The Recall Spell;Original
1049558;The Recall Spell is a fourth (4th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Bloodmoss</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to instantly teleport to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and you will be transported.  Keep in mind that this spell only transports the caster - any pets (unless they are bonded) or friends that are with you, will be left behind.;Original
1049559;The Gate Spell;Original
1049560;The Gate Spell is a seventh (7th) circle spell and requires the <I>Black Pearl</I>, <I>Sullfurous Ash</I> and <I>Mandrake Root</I> <a href = "?37">reagents</a>.<BR><BR>Casting the spell will bring up a targeting cursor.  Target any previously <a href="?94">marked</a> rune, to attempt to open a magical gate to the location at which the rune was <a href="?94">marked</a>.  If the destination location is not blocked (someone or something isn't standing there), the spell will succeed and a temporary gate will open.  The gate will remain open only for a few moments before it closes again.  Anyone wishing to travel through the gate, need only to walk into the gate and they will be transported. <BR><BR>As long as your pets are following you, they too will be transported when they walk into a gate.;Original

1049586;Refreshing Houses;Original
1049587;To keep a house from collapsing, it must be periodically refreshed.  The actual refresh process is different, depending on the refresh type of the house.  Here is a list of all the different refresh types along with information on how a house enters the given refresh state.<BR><BR><U>Condemned</U><BR><BR>A house will be condemned when the house owner either places or accepts the transfer of a new home, or if the owner's player account becomes inactive.  Condemnation will affect all houses on all shards (except in the case of a transfer or newly placed house, in which case the last house that was acquired will not be condemned, but rather will enter into the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state. See below for details.).<BR><BR>Although the contents of a condemned house are still accessible as they normally would, the house cannot be refreshed.  In addition to not being refreshable, the house will collapse within 2 days of being condemned.  If a house entered the <I>condemned</I> status because the house owner's account became inactive, the house(s) may be uncondemned by the house owner, by openeing the front door.  Otherwise, the house can only be uncondemned by transferring or re-deeding it.<BR><BR><U>Grandfathered</U><BR><BR>These houses will be need to be manually refreshed by the house owner, one of the co-owners or house friends.  Refreshing is done by simply opening the front door.<BR><BR><U>Automatic</U><BR><BR>When an account has only one house across all shards, that house enters the <I>Automatic</I> refresh state.  These houses will never decay, unless they enter the <I>Condemned</I> state for any reason.  These houses will never have to be manually refreshed.;Original

1049683;Followers are pets, hirelings, and constructs under your control.  They are gained in a variety of different ways, including Animal Taming, trading, crafting, or just handing a pile of gold to an out-of-work mercenary.  All players may have up to five followers.  On top of this, some individual followers may count as more than one follower.  For example, a dragon counts as three followers, a hireling counts as two, and a horse counts as one.  This means you could have a dragon and two horses, or two mercenaries and one horse, or any combination thereof.<br><br>Note: Some powerful creatures, such as dragons, also require Animal Taming and Animal Lore to control, regardless of the number of followers you have.;Original

1054041;"Study of the Solen Hive";Original
1054042;<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes, regarding you with a hopeful look in his eyes.</I><BR><BR>Um..yes..excuse me. I was wondering if you could offer me a bit of assistance. You see, I'm a naturalist of some repute - a gentleman and a scholar if you will - primarily interested in the study of insects and arachnids. While I've written a few interesting books on the marvelous Terathan race and their bizarre culture, now I've heard tales of a truly significant new discovery!<BR><BR>Apparently a race of ant-like creatures known as the Solen have appeared in our world, scuttling up from some previously hidden home. Can you believe it? Truly these are amazing times! To a scholar such as myself this is indeed an exciting opportunity.<BR><BR>That said, while I may be a genius of some reknown, sharp as a tack and quick with the quill, I'm afraid I'm not much of the adventuring type. Though I have gained assistance before, I still have many unanswered questions.<BR><BR>I am particularly interested in the Solen Egg Nests that are studiously protected by the Solen workers. If you would be so kind as to assist me, I would ask that you travel into the Solen Hive and inspect each of the Solen Egg Nests that reside within. You will have to spend some time examining each Nest before you have gathered enough information. Once you are done, report back to me and I will reward you as best as I can for your valiant efforts!<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?;Original
1054043;Ah! This is splendid news! Each time an assistant travels into the Solen Hive to gather information for me, I feel as if I am one step closer to some grand discovery. Though I felt the same way when I was certain that Terathans had the ability to change their shape to resemble various fruits and vegetables - a point on which I am certain further study of the beasts will prove correct.<BR><BR>In any case, I cannot thank you enough! Please return to me when you have studied all the Solen Egg Nests hidden within the Solen Hive.;Original
1054044;Find an entrance to the Solen Hive, and search within for the Solen Egg Nests. Each Nest must be studied for some time without a break in concentration in order to gather useful information.<BR><BR>Once you have completed your study of the Nests, return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.;Original
1054045;You begin studying the Solen Egg Nest to gather information.;Original
1054046;You abandon your study of the Solen Egg Nest without gathering the needed information.;Original
1054047;You glance at the Egg Nest, realizing you've already studied this one.;Original
1054048;You have studied enough Solen Egg Nests to gather a fair amount of useful information. Return to the Naturalist who gave you this task.;Original
1054049;<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a frustrated look on his face.</I><BR><BR>Haven't you finished the task I appointed you yet? Gah! It's so difficult to find a good apprentice these days.<BR><BR>Remember, you must first find an entrance to the Solen Hive. Once inside, I need you to examine the Solen Egg Nests for me. When you have studied all four nests, you should have enough information to earn yourself a reward.<BR><BR>Now go on, away with you! I have piles of notes from other more helpful apprentices that I still need to study!;Original
1054050;<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with a pleased expression on his face.</I><BR><BR>Ah! Thank you, my goodly apprentice! These notes you have gathered will no doubt assist me in my understanding of these fascinating Solen creatures.<BR><BR>Now, since you've done such a fine job, I feel that I should give you a little reward.<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>As a reward for your fine efforts, I present you with this strange rare seed. Which reminds me, I still need to compile my notes on Solen dietary habits. They are voracious seed eaters, those Solen Matriarchs!<BR><BR>In any case, I must get back to my notes now. I give you my thanks once more, and bid a good day to you my little apprentice! If you wish to help me out again, just say the word.;Original
1054051;<I>The Naturalist looks up from his notes with an ecstatic look upon his face.</I><BR><BR>Oh my! These notes you've brought me - they say you have information on the Secret Solen Egg Nest? I've heard many tales of this secret store of special Solen Eggs, but there are many missing gaps in my notes concerning it.<BR><BR>The notes you've made here will most certainly advance my understanding of this mysterious breed of creatures!<BR><BR>Considering the amazing effort you put into your work, I feel as if I should give you something extra special as a bonus. Hrmm...<BR><BR>I have a botanist friend who has discovered a strange mutation in the plants she has grown. Through science and sorcery, she has managed to produce a rare mutant strain of colored seeds the like of which no gardener has laid eyes upon.<BR><BR>I've given a few of her seeds out to various apprentices - but I usually keep her very rare stock all for myself. They're quite amazing looking! However, since you've done such a fine job for me, I'll present you with one of these rare fire-red seeds.<BR><BR>Once again, my thanks to you! Now I really must get back to studying these notes! Take care, my fine apprentice, and come back if you wish to help me further!;Original
1054052;<I>The Naturalist looks up from his scribbled notes.</I><BR><BR>Greetings!<BR><BR>If you're interested in helping out a scholar of some repute, I do have some work that I could use some assistance with.<BR><BR>You seem a little preoccupied with another task right now, however. Perhaps you should finish whatever it is that has your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.;Original
1054053;<I>The Naturalist looks at you with a friendly expression.</I><BR><BR>I see you've returned with information for me. While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment. Perhaps you'd better free up some room before we get to discussing your reward.;Original
1054054;You have completed your study of this Solen Egg Nest. You put your notes away.;Original
1054055;Solen Nests Studied :;Original
1054056;You notice something very odd about this Solen Egg Nest. You begin taking notes.;Original
1054057;You complete your examination of this bizarre Egg Nest. The Naturalist will undoubtedly be quite interested in these notes!;Original
1054058;You begin recording your completed notes on a bit of parchment.;Original
1054059;<I>The Solen queen considers you for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Hmmm... I could perhaps benefit from your assistance, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Return to me when you complete whatever it is that you're working on and maybe I can still put you to good use.;Original
1054060;<I>The Solen queen considers you eagerly for a moment then says,</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes, I think you could be of use. Normally, of course, I would handle these things on my own, but these are busy times. Much to do, much to do. And besides, if I am to one day become the Matriarch, then it will be good to have experience trusting others to carry out various tasks for me. Yes.<BR><BR>That is my plan, you see - I will become the next Matriarch. Our current Matriarch is fine and all, but she won't be around forever. And when she steps down, I intend to be the next in line. Ruling others is my destiny, you see.<BR><BR>What I ask of you is quite simple. First, I need you to remove some of the - well - competition, I suppose. Though I dare say most are hardly competent to live up to such a title. I'm referring to the other queens of this colony, of course. My dear sisters, so to speak. If you could remove 5 of them, I would be most pleased. *sighs* By remove, I mean kill them. Don't make that face at me - this is how things work in a proper society, and ours has been more proper than most since the dawn of time. It's them or me, and whenever I give it any thought, I'm quite sure I'd prefer it to be them.<BR><BR>I also need you to gather some zoogi fungus for me - 50 should do the trick.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?;Original
1054061;<I>The Solen queen smiles as you decide to help her.</I><BR><BR>Excellent. We'll worry about the zoogi fungus later - start by eliminating 5 queens from my colony.<BR><BR>That part's important, by the way; they must be queens from my colony. Killing queens from the other solen colony does little to help me become Matriarch of this colony and will not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Oh, and none of those nasty infiltrator queens either. They perform a necessary duty, I suppose, spying on the other colony. I fail to see why that couldn't be left totally to the warriors, though. Nevertheless, they do not count as well.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.;Original
1054062;Kill 5 red solen queens.;Original

1054066;<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>You're back, but you have not yet eliminated 5 queens from my colony. Return when you have completed this task.<BR><BR>Remember, by the way, that queens from the other solen colony and infiltrator queens do not count toward your task.<BR><BR>Very well. Carry on. I'll be waiting for your return.;Original
1054067;You've completed your task of slaying solen queens. Return to the ambitious queen who asked for your help.;Original
1054068;<I>The Solen queen looks pleased to see you.</I><BR><BR>Splendid! You've done quite well in reducing my competition to become the next Matriarch. Now I must ask that you gather some zoogi fungus for me. I must practice processing it into powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I believe the amount we agreed upon earlier was 50. Please return when you have that amount and then give them to me.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.;Original
1054069;Gather zoogi fungus until you have 50 of them, then give them to the ambitious queen you are helping.;Original
1054070;<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Do you have the zoogi fungus?<BR><BR>If so, give them to me. Otherwise, go gather some and then return to me.;Original
1054071;I have not asked you to bring me any zoogi fungus, therefore I cannot accept these.;Original
1054072;Our arrangement was for 50 of the zoogi fungus. Please return to me when you have that amount.;Original
1054073;<I>The Solen queen smiles as she takes the zoogi fungus from you.</I><BR><BR>Wonderful! I greatly appreciate your help with these tasks. My plans are beginning to take shape ensuring that I will be the next Matriarch. But there is still much to be done until then.<BR><BR>You've done what I've asked of you and for that I thank you. Please accept this bag of sending and some powder of translocation as a reward. Oh, and I suppose I should give you some gold as well. Yes, yes. Of course.;Original
1054074;You have been given a bag of sending.;Original
1054075;You have been given some powder of translocation.;Original
1054076;You have been given some gold.;Original
1054077;<I>The Solen queen looks at you with a smile.</I><BR><BR>While I'd like to finish conducting our business, it seems that you're a bit overloaded with equipment at the moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps you should free some room in your backpack before we proceed.;Original
1054078;<I>The Solen queen looks up as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Ah good, you've returned. I will conclude our business by giving you any remaining rewards I owe you for aiding me.;Original
1054079;<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>Thank you for that seed. It was quite delicious.  <BR><BR>I would offer to make you a friend of my colony, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.;Original
1054080;Thank you for that plant seed. Those have such wonderful flavor.;Original
1054081;<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>It is good to see you again. I would offer to process some zoogi fungus for you, but you seem to be busy with another task at the moment. Perhaps you should finish whatever is occupying your attention at the moment and return to me once you're done.;Original
1054082;<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as she eats the seed you offered.</I><BR><BR>I think you for that seed. I was quite delicious. So full of flavor.<BR><BR>Hmm... if you would like, I could make you a friend of my colony. This would stop the warriors, workers, and queens of my colony from thinking you are an intruder, thus they would not attack you. In addition, as a friend of my colony I will process zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you.<BR><BR>To become a friend of my colony, I ask that you complete a couple tasks for me. These are the same tasks I will ask of you when you wish me to process zoogi fungus, by the way.<BR><BR>First, I would like for you to eliminate some infiltrators from the other solen colony. They are spying on my colony, and I fear for the safety of my people. They must be slain.<BR><BR>After that, I must ask that you gather some water for me. Our water supplies are inadequate, so we must try to supplement our reserve using water vats here in our lair.<BR><BR>Will you accept my offer?;Original
1054083;<I>The Solen Matriarch smiles happily as you greet her.</I><BR><BR>Hello again. It is always good to see a friend of our colony.<BR><BR>Would you like me to process some zoogi fungus into powder of translocation for you?

My colony is thankful.<BR><BR>Now I must ask that you gather some water for me. A standard pitcher of water holds approximately one gallon. Please decant 8 gallons of fresh water into our water vats.<BR><BR>Farewell for now.;Original

Two of the zoogi fungi are required for each measure of the powder. I will process up to 200 zoogi fungi into 100 measures of powder of translocation.<BR><BR>I will also give you some gold for assisting me and my colony, but first let's take care of your zoogi fungus.;Original

I suppose you're another one of those meddlesome kids, come to ask me for something?  Eh?  Is that it?  You want something from me, expect me to hand it over?  I've enough troubles with my apprentices, and that vile imp, Zeefzorpul!  Why, I bet it's him who's got the lot of them!  And who knows what he's done?  Vile little thing.<BR><BR>If you expect me to help you with your silly little desires, you'll be doing something for me first, eh?  I expect you to go seek out my apprentice.  I sent him along the road west of here up towards Yew's graveyard, but he never came back. Find him, and bring him back, and I'll give you a little reward that I'm sure you'll find pleasant.<BR><BR>But I tells ye to watch out for the imp name've Zeefzorpul!

What would Zeefzorpul want with my Apprentice?  Probably just wants to make life more miserable for me than it already is.<BR><BR>Wait! Bah! That must be it! Zeefzorpul must have found out that I sent my Apprentices out with various Magic Brew Recipes - lists of tasks and ingredients that needed completing.<BR><BR>That despicable Zeefzorpul knows I need the list of ingredients I gave to that Apprentice.  I've recipes to mix, stews to boil, magics to cast, and fortunes to meddle!  I won't let that wretched felchscum spoil my day.

He think he so smart but he so wrong!  I make scribble drawing of where he like to hide!  But you need the whistle blower to make him come!  He no come without it!  Make with the whistle at his hidey place, and Zeef must come, he cannot resist!<BR><BR><I>The frightened imp hands you a crumpled map and a strange flute.</I><BR><BR>You go to where the picture shows and then you play that whistle!

Mighty Zeefzorpul do what you want!  Have you stupid paper back!  Mighty Zeefzorpul no want it any way.  It dumb.  It super dumb.  Big dumb like stupid dumb tree with dumb things on it!  So stupid!  So dumb that mighty Zeefzorpul not even care!  You see me not caring?  You better cause it certainly happening!  Me not caring one bit!<BR><BR><I>The strange little imp tosses the piece of parchment at you.  Much to your surprise, however, he swoops down in a flash of flapping wings and steals the Magic Flute from your grasp.</I><BR><BR>Hah! So stupid like a hooman!  Mighty Zeefzorpul has defeated stupid hooman and is greatest ever imp in world!  You serious stupid, mister hooman.  Big stupid with stupid on top.  Now you no can make trick on me again with crazy dance music!

Well, you can go on expecting, and I can go on being ugly.  What good is it to me that I have the list, if I don't have an apprentice to go gather the ingredients and perform the tasks themselves!<BR><BR>If you want your precious little reward, you'll have to complete the task I gave to my previous Apprentice.

Even if she is a bit old and wrinkled.<BR><BR>Well, I promised you a reward for your efforts, and I never lie - leastways not to someone like you, after the great sacrifices you've made.  You know, I could use a new Apprentice, in an official capacity as it were.  I couldn't convince you to stay around and help me out some more could I?  There's always cauldrons that need cleaning, dung that needs shoveling, newts eye that needs a proper chewing, and fires that need stoking.<BR><BR>What's that? Not interested?

You'd best make room in your pack for the Hag's reward before speaking to her again.</I>;Original

Listen, you little wretch, I'm in no mood for any of your meddlesome requests. I've work to do, and no time for your whining.<BR><BR>Come back later, and maybe I'll have something for you to do. In the meantime, get out of my sight - and don't touch anything on your way out!<BR><BR><I>The vile hag hacks up a gob of phlegm, spitting it on the ground before returning to her work.</I>;Original

1055081;<I>Elwood greets you warmly, like an old friend he's not quite sure he ever had.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Yes. Sit down. Please. Good. Okay, stand. Up to you.<BR><BR>So, what brings you to these parts... hey, wait. Just had a thought. Would you like to do me a favor? Yes, really. You know, for old times sake. The good ole days. You were always one of my best suppliers. Or maybe you weren't, who knows any more. Anyway, could use some help supplementing my stock. You know me. Always looking for something new to add to the collection. Or sometimes not so new - just more of the same. But don't have to tell you that. You know, don't you. Yes. Just like old times. That's what it'll be. You and me - together again. Ah, it's been too long.<BR><BR>So what do you think? The fee will be the same as always. I'm a fair man. You know that. So what do you say?;Original
1055082;<I>Elwood looks a bit flustered and nearly knocks over his bottle of ale.</I><BR><BR>Well, I see. It's like that, is it? Yes. Well then. Okay. You've changed. Yes. Yes, you have. Something's changed. I know I haven't. Not me. Not good ole Elwood.<BR><BR><I>Elwood trails off, though you can still hear him muttering softly.</I>;Original
1055083;<I>Elwood slaps his knee and grins at you.</I><BR><BR>Yes. Yes. That's the spirit. I knew it. Knew it when I first saw you. You remind me so much of your dear departed father. Or someone. Not sure. Maybe no one. But that's okay. Ah, good times.<BR><BR>Anyway, so as you know, I'm a collector. Got all kinds of interesting things laying around back at my warehouse. You know. You've seen it. Haven't you? Yes? No? Nevermind. Not important.<BR><BR>Right. So, always trying to add new things to my collection. Or sometimes just get more of something. Can't have too many. Right? Yeah? Sure.<BR><BR>Let's see. Where to start. Oh, I know. Pearls. Yes. But not just any pearls. Rainbow pearls. Yes. From the lake here in Haven. Seems all that magic Uzeraan was throwing around when he transformed the island had an interesting effect on some of the shellfish down there. Exactly, rainbow pearls. Useless for magic, but an item worth collecting. Trust me on this. Trust me.<BR><BR>Need you to go fish some up for me. Down at the lake. Lake Haven. Off ya go. Happy fishing!<BR><BR><I>Elwood turns back to his ale and now seems oblivious to you.</I>;Original

1055090;<I>Elwood jumps slightly when you call his name.</I><BR><BR>What. I'm awake. Oh, It's you. Hey, look at those pearls. Beautiful. Wow. Where'd you get those... oh right. I sent you to get them. From the lake. Lake Haven. Great job. Gotta love rainbow pearls. Oooh, Colors.<BR><BR>Okay, let's see. Next. Need a painting. Go to the Colored Canvas and speak to Alberta. Alberta Giacco. Best painter I've ever met. Ask her to do a painting of you. Yes. Of you. A portrait. Never know if you might up and become famous one day. Need to have a painting of you in my collection. From now. Before all the fame. Go. Alberta awaits. She's in Vesper.<BR><BR><I>Elwood starts playing with the pearls you brought him and seems to have forgotten you're there.</I>;Original
1055091;Go to Vesper and speak to Alberta Giacco at the Colored Canvas.;Original
1055092;<I>Alberta looks up from the painting she is working on and faces you.</I><BR><BR>Excuse me. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in the middle of something, and can't... oh wait, I see. You must be the one Elwood sent over.<BR><BR>Very well. If you'll have a seat on the stool over there, we'll get started. This will just take a few seconds. I paint quite quickly, you see. I'll start once you are seated.<BR><BR><I>Alberta exchanges the painting she was working on for a blank canvas.</I>;Original
1055093;Sit on the stool in front of Alberta's easel so that she can paint your portrait. You'll need to sit there for about 30 seconds.;Original
1055094;<I>Elwood yawns and stretches, then focuses his gaze on you.</I><BR><BR>Hello. Do I know you? Hold on a second. Yes. Yes, I do. You were going to bring me some rainbow pearls. Wait. No. You already did that. I remember now. Right. So go get that portrait painted. Alberta is in Vesper. Go to her. Alberta Giacco. Come back when she's done.;Original
1055095;You must remain seated on the stool until the portrait is complete. Alberta will now have to start again with a fresh canvas.;Original
1055096;<I>Alberta looks at you sympathetically.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, this will only take a few seconds. I realize that stool can be uncomfortable, and I apologize for that. Perhaps I should replace it with a more comfortable chair. But then again, it's that very discomfort that helps produce such wonderful facial expressions for my paintings. Ah well.;Original
1055097;<I>Elwood drums his fingers on the counter then looks up at you expectantly.</I><BR><BR>Ah, finally. I'm famished. This so-called tavern doesn't even serve pizza, so one must have it delivered. It's an outrage. Er... wait. Where's my pizza? Yes, my pizza. What kind of delivery is this? Didn't even bring my pizza. This will severely impact your tip, I'm afraid.<BR><BR>Hold on a moment. You were helping me with something else, weren't you? Ah. Yes. I've got it now. You were to have a portrait done. Well. Good. Yes. But let's not dawdle. Off you go. If you happen to see anyone with my pizza, please insist they hurry.<BR><BR>;Original
1055098;<I>Alberta stands back from the canvas and surveys her work.</I><BR><BR>Not too bad. Quite good even, if I do say so myself. As always, of course.<BR><BR>Oh, you're still here. Please let Elwood know that the painting has been completed. I'll have it sent to him once it dries.<BR><BR><I>Alberta removes the portrait from her easel and sets it aside to dry.</I>;Original
1055099;Return to Elwood and let him know that the painting is complete.;Original
1055100;<I>Elwood notices you immediately and waves you over.</I><BR><BR>You're back. Good. That's good. Hmm. You don't seem to have that painting yet. Don't tell me Alberta refused. That's no good. I made her what she is! She was living in the gutter when I found her. The gutter. And she has the... what's that? Oh, she finished the portrait. Right. Good. Can always count on Alberta. Always. Best painter in the land.<BR><BR>Just have a couple... er... wait... make that... two more task for you. Then our business will be concluded. For now. Old chums like us will always work together again. Yes. We go so far back. Right. I think.<BR><BR>Anyway. There's a musician. A minstrel. His name's Gabriel Piete. Quite the good singer. One of my favorites. Absolute favorite. What I'd like is his autograph. Simple. Just his autograph. You're likely to find him at the Conservatory of Music in Britain. He's often there. Often. Between performances. Hurry now. There ya go.<BR><BR><I>Elwood falls silent though his lips are still  moving. It looks like he's quietly repeating the word, "autograph."</I>;Original

1055102;<I>Alberta stops cleaning her brushes and looks your way.</I><BR><BR>Don't worry, I'll send the painting to Elwood once it's dry. Please let him know that the painting has been finished.;Original
1055103;<I>Gabriel sighs loudly as you address him and stops whatever it was that he was doing.</I><BR><BR>WHAT?!? Can you not see that I'm working here?  Ugh, sometimes I wish they'd just lock the outer doors to anyone who doesn't belong here. So go ahead and fawn. Get it over with, and then leave. Sooner you're out of here, the sooner I'm back to work.<BR><BR>I see. So you want an autograph. Fine. If it'll get rid of you, I'll give you my autograph. But I'll only sign some sheet music for one of my songs. Until then, please let me get back to work.<BR><BR>You can probably find some of my sheet music at one of the theaters in the land. When I perform there, they often sell it as a souvenir. Speak to the impresario... the theater manager. My last three performances were in Nujel'm, Jhelom, and here in Britian.;Original
1055104;Find some sheet music for one of Gabriel's songs. Try speaking to an impresario from one of the theaters in the land.;Original
1055105;<I>Elwood jumps and almost falls from his stool when you tap his shoulder.</I><BR><BR>Oh my. Don't do that. Scared me half to death. Sneaking up on people like that. I don't even know you. Yes, I do. I do know you. Ordered a pizza from you and never received it. I'm rather miffed about that.<BR><BR>No. No. Wait. Of course. Not the pizza. You're here with the moonfire brew I wanted. Magical moonfire brew. Not sure what it is. Just want some.<BR><BR>What's that? Oh. The autograph. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Of course. Do you have it? No. Well. Hmm. Don't sneak up on people like that. Not polite.;Original
1055106;Sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song? No, I'm sorry, but we've run out. We might get some more after he performs here again, but right now we don't have any. My apologies.;Original
1055107;Sure, I have some sheet music for a Gabriel Piete song. I'd be happy to sell you a copy for 10 gold.;Original
1055108;You don't have enough gold to buy the sheet music.;Original
1055109;The theater impresario hands you some sheet of music for one of Gabriel Piete's songs.;Original
1055110;Speak to Gabriel to have him autograph the sheet music.;Original
1055111;<I>Gabriel does not look happy to see you.</I><BR><BR>Do you have any sheet music? No. Please return when you do, but until then please leave me to my work.;Original
1055112;<I>Elwood seems to be studying the bottom of his bottle of ale as you approach.</I><BR><BR>What's this? Strange. Quite strange. I could have sworn I was drinking wine.<BR><BR>Oh, hello. Yes. Good to see you. Any luck with that autograph?  Bet you thought I'd forgotten. No. Not me. Mind like a steel trap. Can't get it open no matter how hard you try. Or something. No luck yet? Ah well. keep trying. I have faith in you. Whoever you are.;Original
1055113;<I>Gabriel looks up impatiently as you approach.</I><BR><BR>Good. We can finally be done with one another. Here, let me sign that and have this business completed.<BR><BR><I>Gabriel takes the sheet music, autographs it, and then hands it back to you.</I>;Original
1055114;Speak to Elwood to give him the autographed sheet music.;Original
1055115;<I>Elwood scratches his ear then notices you.</I><BR><BR>Good day. What brings you to the Albatross? Me? An autograph? You want my autograph? Well, I suppose. What's that? Oh. Yes. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Get his autograph and return to me. Good day.;Original
1055116;<I>Elwood looks up eagerly as you tell him about the autographed sheet music.</I><BR><BR>Quite good work. Not an easy one to deal with, that one. Gabriel Piete. Yes. Well done. Nice autograph.<BR><BR>One last task. I would like a set of toy monster figurines made by the famous toymaker, Tomas O'Neerlan. You'll find him in Trinsic. He's often at the Tinker's Guild. Try looking there.<BR><BR>You're doing quite well. Quite well indeed. Knew you would. Just like old times. Yes. Quite good.;Original
1055117;Go to Trinsic and speak to Tomas O'Neerlan, the famous toymaker.;Original
1055118;<I>Gabriel ignores you.</I>;Original
1055119;<I>Tomas smiles freely as you speak to him.</I><BR><BR>Ah, to be sure I can make you some toy monster figurines. That's my work, making toys. Worry not, we'll put together a good set of monsters for you and your figurines.<BR><BR>But I'll be needing something from you before I can begin. Here, take these enchanted paints. Using them, you can capture a set of images of the creatures you wish me to make into toys. It'll only work on the group of creatures I select for your set of figurines. Oh, and I'll be needing those enchanted paints back when all is said and done.<BR><BR>;Original

Not to worry. Keep at it. No doubt you'll come through with those.<BR><BR>Excuse me a moment. I think I need to sit down. Wait. I am sitting down. Good then. Yes. Sitting down.<BR><BR><I>Elwood reaches out and takes hold of the counter as if to steady himself.</I>;Original

1055130;<I>Elwood suddenly stops and beckons you over to him.</I><BR><BR>Over here. Come here. Don't be alarmed, but I think one of the tavernkeepers used to be a wandering healer. Said something about the good ole days when people would just walk up and hand gold to them. Piles of gold. Out of the blue. Can you imagine? Got so much gold, this ex-healer decided to buy a tavern and settle down. Kind of sad really. Can't even cure my hangover now. Nice tavern though.<BR><BR>Right. Anyway. Let me know when those toy figurines are ready. I'll be here. As always.;Original
1055131;<I>Tomas grins as you walk toward him.</I><BR><BR>I see that you have collected all of the images we need. 'Tis good. I'll begin straight away on the toy figurines. I'll have them delivered to you when ready. Where shall I send them? To Elwood in Haven? Yes, I know him. We've done business in the past. Odd fellow.<BR><BR>Tomas smiles as you return his enchanted paints back to him.<BR><BR>;Original
1055132;Return to Elwood with news that the toy figurines will be delivered when ready.;Original
1055133;<I>Elwood is singing as you greet him.</I><BR><BR>Come. Join in. It's a Gabriel Piete song. I have the sheet music for it. It's even autographed by Gabriel Piete himself. Yes. One of his songs. Brilliant.<BR><BR>So let me see the toys. Figurines. Let's see them. Oh. You don't have them yet. I see. Well. Okay. That's too bad.;Original
1055134;<I>Elwood takes a sip of his ale as you address him.</I><BR><BR>Ah. That's the stuff. Ale. Nothing better. What's that? Toy figurines will be delivered. Right. Yes. Perhaps better than Ale. Tough one.<BR><BR>Very good work. Quite. Think we're all done now. You completed everything I asked. Would work with you again. Yes. We should.<BR><BR>Ah. Yes. your payment. The usual. I think you'll be pleased.<BR><BR><I>With that Elwood rummages around in his backpack. He eventually pulls out a small bag and hands it to you.</I>;Original
1055135;<I>Elwood stares at you as you approach.</I><BR><BR>I know you. Oh yes. You've been running some errands for me. We are about done. Noticed that your backpack is a bit full. Might want to make some room. Won't be able to hold your payment. Come back when you have more room, and we'll conclude our business.;Original

What's this?  Another budding Necromancer to join the ranks of Evil?  Here... let me take a look at you...  Ah yes...  Very Good! I sense the forces of evil are strong within you, child – but you need training so that you can learn to focus your skills against those aligned against our cause.  You are destined to become a legendary Necromancer - with the proper training, that only I can give you.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth pauses just long enough to give you a wide, skin-crawling grin.</I><BR><BR>Let me introduce myself.

1060099;Excellent choice, young apprentice of evil!<BR><BR>I will not waste our time with pleasantries.  There is much work to be done – especially in light of the recent Paladin ambushes that we have suffered.  The necromantic brotherhood is working towards the summoning of the elder daemon Kronus, who will rise from the Well of Tears to help us finally crush the Paladin forces that have plagued our lands for so long now.<BR><BR>To summon Kronus, we must energize the Well of Tears with a series of dark rituals.  Unfortunately the rituals needed to sufficiently energize the Well of Tears have been lost to us.  Your task will be to recover one of the ritual scrolls needed for the summoning.<BR><BR>You will need to find the corpse of the Arch Necromancer Maabus, which has been laid to rest in the tomb of elders.  We believe his spirit may have memory of where we may find the scrolls needed for the summoning.  You will need to awaken him from the slumber of death, using your Animate Dead spell, of course.<BR><BR>To reach the tomb, step onto the magical teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing.<BR><BR>Once you have been teleported, follow the path, which will lead you to the tomb of Maabus.<BR><BR>One more thing before you go:<BR><BR>Should you get into trouble out there or should you lose your way, do not worry. I have also given you a magical horn - a <I>Horn of Retreat</I>. Play the horn at any time to open a magical gateway that leads back to this tower.<BR><BR>Should your horn run out of <a href = "?ForceTopic83">charges</a>, simply hand me the horn to have it recharged.<BR><BR>Good luck friend.;Original
1060100;...;Original
1060101;...;Original
1060102;Re-animate the corpse of Maabus using your <a href="?ForceTopic112">Animate Dead</a> spell and question him about the Kronus rituals.;Original
1060103;<I>Maabus emits an ear-crawling screech as his body reanimates.  He turns and angrily screams at you</I>:<BR><BR>YOU INFIDEL!  HOW DARE YOU AWAKEN MAABUS!?!<BR><BR><I>Maabus continues to scream at you angrily for some time.  As he settles down, you explain to him the purpose of your visit.  Once you explain that you are on a quest to summon the elder daemon Kronus, Maabus begins to cooperate, and begins to speak in a more reasonable tone</I>:<BR><BR>Well, why didn’t you say so?  If you’re going to raise Kronus from the Well of Tears, you must first complete a long series of dark rituals.  I once owned one of the scrolls needed for the summoning, but alas it was lost to me when I lost my life to a cowardly Paladin ambush near the Paladin city of Light.  They would have probably hidden the scroll in their precious crystal cave near the city.<BR><BR>There is a teleporter in the corner of this tomb.  It will transport you near the crystal cave at which I believe one of the calling scrolls is hidden.  Good luck.<BR><BR><I>Maabus' body slumps back into the coffin as your magic expires</I>.;Original
1060104;Take the teleporter in the corner of Maabus' tomb to the crystal cave where the calling scroll is kept.;Original
1060105;<I>An old man, dressed in slightly tattered armor, whom you recognize to be a Paladin stands before the Crystal Cave staring blankly into the space in front of him.  As he begins to speak to you, you realize this man is blind.  You attempt to persuade the blind man that you are a Paladin seeking to inspect the scroll of calling...</I><BR><BR>Greetings traveler!<BR><BR>You seek entrance to the Crystal Cave, home of the Calling Scroll?  Hmm.  You reak of death and decay, brother.  You reak of death like a Necromancer, but yet you claim to be a Paladin in hopes that I will grant thee passage into the cave?<BR><BR>Please don’t think ill of me for this, but I’m just a blind, old man looking to keep the brotherhood of Paladins safe from the clutches of the elder daemon Kronus.  The Necromancers have been after this particular scroll for quite some time, so we must take all the security precautions we can.<BR><BR>Before I can let you pass into the Crystal Cave, you must speak to me the secret word that is kept in the Scroll of Abraxus in the Vault of Secrets at the Paladin city of Light.  It’s the only way that I can be sure you are who you claim to be, since Necromancers cannot enter the Vault due to powerful protective magic that the brotherhood has blessed the vault with.;Original
1060106;Infiltrate the city of the Paladins and figure out a way into the Vault. See Mardoth for help with this objective.;Original
1060107;<I>Mardoth looks at you expectantly until you tell him that you failed to retrieve the scroll...</I><BR><BR>You failed?  Very unfortunate...  So now you must find your way into the paladin’s Vault of Secrets, eh?  Well, you won't be able to get in – there is a powerful magic aura that protects the Vault from all Necromancers.  We simply cannot enter.  However, that's not to say your familiar spirit can't.<BR><BR><I>Mardoth grins with obvious satisfaction as he explains the details of the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell to you...</I>, which will allow you to summon a scavenging Horde Minion to steal the scroll.<BR><BR>Very well.  You are prepared to go.  Take the teleporter just to the <a href = "?ForceTopic13">West</a> of where I am standing to transport to the Paladin city of Light.  Once you have arrived in the city, follow the road of glowing runes to the Vault of Secrets.  You know what to do.;Original
1060108;Use the teleporter near Mardoth to be transported to the Paladin City of Light.;Original
1060109;Follow the road paved with glowing runes to find the Vault of Secrets.  Be careful not to give yourself away as a Necromancer while in the city.;Original
1060110;You have arrived in the Vault of Secrets.  You can feel the protective magic in this place restricting you, making you feel nearly claustrophobic.<BR><BR>Just ahead of you and out of your reach, you see a collection of scrolls and books, one of them being entitled 'Scroll of Abraxus' .  You can only assume that this scroll holds the current password required to enter the Crystal Cave.<BR><BR>This would be a good opportunity to <a href="?ForceTopic127">summon your familiar</a>.  Since your familiar is not a Necromancer, it will not be affected by the anti-magic aura that surrounds the Vault.<BR><BR>Summon your familiar with the <a href="?ForceTopic127">Summon Familiar</a> spell.;Original
1060111;You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the book for you.;Original

1060113;You instinctively will your familiar to fetch the scroll for you.;Original
1060114;You have obtained the Scroll of Abraxus, which contains the secret password needed to gain passage into the Crystal Cave where the Scroll of Calling is kept.  Read the scroll (double click) and figure out the password.<BR><BR>Once you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave and speak the password to the guard.<BR><BR>If you do not know the way to the Crystal Cave from the Paladin City, you can use the magic teleporter located just outside of the vault.;Original
1060115;Now that you have the password, return to the Crystal Cave to speak with the guard there.  Use the teleporter outside of the vault to get there if necessary.;Original
1060116;Security at the Crystal Cave<BR><BR>We have taken great measures to ensure the safety of the Scroll of Calling, which we have so valiantly taken from the Necromancer Maabus during the battle of the wood nearly 200 years ago.<BR><BR>The scroll must never fall into the hands of the Necromancers again, lest they use it to summon the ancient daemon Kronus.  The scroll of calling is a necessity in the series of dark rites the Necromancers must perform to once again re-awaken Kronus.<BR><BR>Should Kronus ever rise again, the days of the Paladins, and indeed humanity as we know it will be numbered.<BR><BR>For this reason, we have posted the honorable Horus, former General of the Northern Legions to guard the entrance of the Crystal Cave where we keep the Scroll of Calling.  Horus was infused with magical life from the tree Urywen during his last battle.  The power gave him eternal life, but it also, unfortunately, took his eye sight.<BR><BR>Since Horus cannot see those he admits to the Crystal Cave, he will only allow those that know the secret password to enter.  Speak the following word to Horus and he shall grant you passage to the Crystal Cave:<BR><BR><I>Urywen</I><BR><BR>Do not speak this password anywhere except when seeking passage into the Crystal Cave, as our adversaries are lurking in the shadows – they are everywhere.<BR><BR>Go with the light, friend.<BR><BR><I>- Frater Melkeer</I>;Original
1060117;Speak the secret word that you read in the scroll stolen from the Vault to Horus the guard, using his <a href="?ForceTopic90">context menu</a>.;Original
1060118;Very well Paladin, you have proven to me your identity.  I grant thee passage.<BR><BR>Be careful, however – I’ve heard that the cave has been infested with a vermin of some sort.  Our High Lord Melkeer was supposed to send some troops to clear the vermin out of the cave, but that was last week already.  I fear that he forgot.<BR><BR>If you can find it in your goodness to dispose of at least 5 of those vermin in there, I shall reward your efforts.  If however you are too busy, and I would understand if you were, don’t bother with the vermin.<BR><BR>You may now pass through the energy barrier to enter the Crystal Cave.   Take care honorable Paladin soul.  Walk in the light my friend.;Original
1060119;Enter the Crystal Cave and find the Scroll of Calling.  The barrier will now allow you to pass.;Original
1060120;You rummage through the scrolls until you find the Scroll of Calling.  You quickly put it in your pack.;Original
1060121;You have returned with the scroll!  I knew I could count on you.  You can now perform the rite of calling at the Well of Tears.  This ritual will help charge the Well to prepare for the coming of Kronus.   You are prepared to do your part young Necromancer!<BR><BR>Just outside of this tower, you will find a path lined with red lanterns.  Follow this path to get to the Well of Tears.  Once you have arrived at the Well, use the scroll to perform the ritual of calling.  Performing the rite will empower the well and bring us that much closer to the arrival of Kronus.<BR><BR>Once you have completed the ritual, return here for your promised reward.;Original
1060122;STOP WICKED ONE!;Original
1060123;I will slay you before I allow you to complete your evil rites!;Original
1060124;Step onto the teleporter near Mardoth and follow the path of glowing runes to the tomb of Maabus.;Original

1060128;Follow the red lanterns to the Well of Tears where you will perform the calling of Kronus.;Original

1060132;Although you were slain by the cowardly paladin, you managed to complete the rite of calling as instructed. Return to Mardoth.;Original
1060133;You have done as I asked... I knew I could count on you from the moment you walked in here!<BR><BR>The forces of evil are strong within you.

I release you from my service to go into the world and fight for our cause...<BR><BR>Oh...I almost forgot - your reward.  Here is a magical weapon and 2000 gold for you, in the form of a check.  Don't spend it all in one place though, eh?<BR><BR>Actually, before you can spend any of it at all, you will have to <a href="?ForceTopic86">cash the check</a> at the nearest bank.  Shopkeepers never accept checks for payment, they require cash.<BR><BR>In your pack, you will find an enchanted sextant.  Use this sextant to guide you to the nearest bank.<BR><BR>Farewell, and stay true to the ways of the shadow...;Original

Let me tell you a bit about the banks in this world...<BR><BR>Anything that you place into any bank box, can be retrieved from any other bank box in the land. For instance, if you place an item into a bank box in Britain, it can be retrieved from your bank box in Moonglow or any other city.<BR><BR> Bank boxes are very secure. So secure, in fact, that no one can ever get into your bank box except for yourself. Security is hard to come by these days, but you can trust in the banking system of Britannia! We shall not let you down! <BR><BR>I hope to be seeing much more of you as your riches grow! May your bank box overflow with the spoils of your adventures.<BR><BR>Farewell adventurer, you are now free to explore the world on your own.;Original

1060211;<I>Cleanse by Fire</I> is the basic Cure ability for the Paladin.  The Paladin uses the Cleanse by Fire ability to neutralize any poisons from a target.  When he does this, he takes an amount of fire damage based on a combination of his Karma and Chivalry levels.  The lower the Paladin's Karma, the higher the fire damage.  The higher the Paladin's Chivalry skill is, the lower the amount of fire damage taken.;Original
1060212;<I>Close Wounds</I> is the basic healing ability for a Paladin.  Using this ability, allows the Paladin to target another player or creature for divine healing.  The amount of Hit Points healed depends on the Paladin’s level of Karma and their skill in Chivalry.  A lower level of Karma lowers the amount of healing but a higher skill level in Chivalry will raise the amount.;Original
1060213;The <I>Consecrate Weapon</I> ability allows the Paladin to temporarily imbue the weapon he is holding with holy magic.<BR><BR> The result is a weapon that deals damage of a type equal to the target’s worst resistance.  In other words,  if a consecrated weapon attacks a Fire Elemental, whose worst resistance is to cold, each hit with the Consecrated Weapon will deal cold damage to that fire elemental.<BR><BR>The duration of the effect is based off of the Paladin's level of Karma and Chivalry skill.  Lower Karma will shorten the effect, but higher Chivalry skill will lengthen the effect.;Original
1060214;The <I>Dispel Evil</I> Paladin ability affects a small area around the Paladin.  Any evil creatures that come into the affected area may be destroyed or repelled, causing them to flee from combat.  This ability targets evil summoned creatures as well as non-summoned evil creatures.<BR><BR><I>Dispel Evil</I> can also target player Necromancers that are under effect of the <I>Wraith Form</I> spell.

1060215;The Paladin’s <I>Divine Fury</I> ability allows him to wage a raging battle against the forces of evil, causing him to swing faster, hit better, and do more damage.

1060216;Your shot was successful;Original
1060217;The <I>Enemy of One</I> Paladin ability causes the <I>next</I> creature the Paladin strikes to become his “mortal enemy”.

1060218;The Paladin’s <I>Holy Light</I> ability is the only direct-damage ability that the Paladin possesses.  Calling on the powers of his faith, he may call forth a magnificent beacon of holy light which damages all enemies in a small radius around the caster.;Original
1060219;The Paladin’s <I>Noble Sacrifice</I> ability allows him to sacrifice himself for the greater good of those in the area.

1060220;The Paladin’s <I>Remove Curse</I> ability allows him to remove all <I>Curse</I> type effects from a single target.  Curses include all Necromancer curses, as well as the spells Feeblemind, Clumsy, Weaken, and Paralyze.;Original

1061666;Book of Chivalry;Original
1061667;The Book of Chivalry, used by Paladins, is akin to the mage's spellbook.  Within the Book of Chivalry are icons used to activate the Paladin's special abilities.  In addition, the Paladin can also inspect the requirements and effects of each ability within the Book of Chivalry.<BR><BR>Books of Chivalry can be <a href = "?ForceTopic33">purchased</a from "Keepers of Chivalry" in the Paladin city of Luna.<BR><BR>Any new character starting with points in Chivalry skill, will find a Book of Chivalry in their pack upon entering the world.;Original
1061668;Sacred Journey;Original
1061669;The Paladin ability Sacred Journey mimics the effect of the mage spell of <a href = "?ForceTopic95">Recall</a> almost exactly, in that it can transport the Paladin to any location to which he or she possesses a <a href = "?ForceTopic94">marked</a> rune.<BR><BR>  Successful use of this ability consumes Tithing points as well as mana.  The chance to succeed is based on Chivalry skill.;Original
1061670;Close Wounds;Original
1061671;<I>Close Wounds<I> is the basic healing spell for a Paladin.  The Paladin uses the ability and then targets the creature he wishes to Heal.  The amount of Hit Points healed depends on the paladin’s <a href = "?ForceTopic45">Karma</a> & Chivalry.;Original

1061675;Necromancers are those who have dedicated their lives to bring death, decay and destruction to Britannia by drawing on the powers of death itself.<BR><BR>Those who wield the power of death have at their disposal an impressive array of spells that aims to bring a gruesome and horrific end to anything that comes between the Necromancer and complete power.<BR><BR>In addition, Necromancers also make excellent melee warriors since any necromantic spell can be cast whilst wielding a weapon (unlike spells of conventional magery).;Original

1061677;Spells of Necromancy;Original
1061678;The spells of Necromancy may be cast by those who have sufficient skill in Necromancy.  All necromantic spells have a mana and <a href = "?37">reagent</a> cost attached to them.

1061679;Spirit Speak;Original
1061680;The Spirit Speak skill is used to heal yourself by channeling spiritual energy.  Spiritual energy may be channeled from either a corpse or the person using the skill.

1062116;This topic covers the basics of housing in UO, from placement to trading to customization.  Please see Related Topics above for more information.;Original
1062117;HOUSE PLACEMENT;Original
1062118;You can create a house by using a <B>house placement tool</B>.  This device can be purchased from an Architect NPC in many towns across the land.  The tool itself is inexpensive, but in order to place a house you will need to have sufficient funds in your bank box to pay for it.  In addition to the tool and funds, you must also have an open spot of land outside of town that is level and free of obstructions.  If you have found such a spot, then double-click your House Placement Tool and choose the type of house to place from the menu.  Next, you will see a ghosted image of the selected house on your targeting cursor.  Position the ghosted house and click to try to place it.  If placement fails, you will be notified as to the reason, and you can try again.  There are several important rules about house placement, which are detailed in the paragraphs following: <a href = "?136">Location</a>, <a href = "?137">Terrain</a>, <a href = "?138">Other Houses</a>, <a href = "?139">Ownership Restrictions</a>.;Original
1062119;LOCATIONS;Original
1062120;<B>Locations:</B>  <a href = "?135" >House placement</a> is not allowed within the boundaries of any town or other region protected by guards.  Housing is also not allowed near any dungeon entrance or shrine.  The area known as the Lost Lands, and the entire facet of Ilshenar are also not suitable for housing.  Finally, some areas have been reserved for other reasons.  When you try to place in these illegal locations, you will be informed that housing is not allowed there.;Original
1062121;TERRAIN;Original
1062122;<B>Terrain:</B>  Houses can only be <a href = "?135">built</a> on level terrain that is free of obstruction.  The entire plot of land that your new house will rest on must all be completely flat.  Furthermore, the house's foundation and front steps cannot rest on any obstruction, or be adjacent to any obstruction.  An obstruction is considered to be a part of the landscape that a player cannot walk over.  Obstructions may exist <B>under</B> the house, so long as they are not tall enough to poke up through the floor of the house.  It must be possible to walk all the way around the house staying adjacent to its walls or front steps, without being blocked by anything on the terrain.;Original
1062123;OTHER HOUSES;Original
1062124;<B>Other Houses:</B>  When <a href = "?135">placing a new house</a>, remember that no two houses can be adjacent in the east/west direction -- there must be an unobstructed path at least one tile wide between any two houses.  Also, there is a five-tile buffer zone to the north and south of a house that must remain clear of all other houses.  Finally, you cannot place a house whose corner is adjacent diagonally to the corner of another house.;Original
1062125;OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS;Original
1062126;<B>Ownership Restrictions:  </B>You may only <a href = "?135">place</a> or be <a href = "?140">traded</a> a house once every 7 days.  You may only own one house on your account.  If you place or receive a second house, any other house(s) on your account, across all shards, will become <a href = "?97">condemned</a>.;Original
1062127;HOUSE TRADING;Original
1062128;You can buy a house from another player or sell a house to another player, using the standard Trade Window.  It is not possible to exchange houses this way.  In order to have a house traded to you, you must meet all house <a href = "?139">ownership restrictions</a>.  If you do, then it is possible for the house owner to open a trade window containing a house trade scroll.  For this to happen, both you and the house owner must be outside the house and standing within two paces of the house sign.  You both must remain within 2 tiles of the house sign or the trade will fail.  The trade scroll shows the name of the house owner, the name of the house, and the sextant coordinates of the house.  This scroll is also a distinctive ice-blue color that cannot be faked.  <B>Be sure to verify you are buying the correct house!</B>  Once both parties double-check the trade and agree to it, the house is transferred.;Original
1062129;HOUSE CONVERSION;Original
1062130;If you have a static non-customizable house, it may be possible to convert it into a <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a>.  The following house types <B>cannot</B> be converted:  Castles, Keeps, Two-Story Wood and Plaster, and Two-Story Stone and Plaster.  All other house types can be converted.  When you convert a house into a dirt lot, the house vanishes and is replaced with a dirt lot exactly the same size as the original house.  This conversion is completely secure and automatic, so there is no risk of losing your house.  If you meet the <a href = "?139">restrictions</a> for owning a customizable dirt lot, you may perform the conversion using your house sign menu.<BR><BR>When you convert the house, you are refunded the original purchase price of the house, then charged the cost of the equivalent dirt lot.  In most cases, the original cost of a house is more than the cost of a dirt lot with the same footprint, meaning you will get a refund (which can be used towards customizing your lot).  Note that "original purchase price" refers to the cost of the deed used to place the house, or the cost listed on the House Placement Tool menu for the house, and <B>not</B> the amount the house was traded for in its last player-to-player trade.;Original
1062131;HOUSE RESTRICTIONS;Original
1062132;You are limited to owning one house on your account across all shards.  If you own a house on one shard, you cannot own a house on another shard.  If at any time you place a new house or receive a house in trade, your house will become condemned.  A condemned house will decay within 5 days.  The only way to un-condemn a house is to trade it to another player.  If you trade away your new house, this will <B>not</B> un-condemn your other house.<BR><BR>Whenever you place a house or receive on in trade with another player, you may not place another house or receive another house in trade for seven days, even if you demolish the house or trade it to another player.<BR><BR>In order to own a <a href = "?143?">customizable</a> house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online:  Age of Shadows</I>.  If your account is not upgraded, you cannot place a customizable <a href = "?144?">dirt lot</a>, nor can you receive a customizable house in trade.;Original
1062133;HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION;Original
1062134;Customizable houses have two modes: <a href = "?168">normal</a> and <a href = "?169">customization</a>.<BR><BR>When you enter Customization Mode, all of the house's contents are either ejected or packed into a <a href = "?170">Moving Crate</a>.  As you customize your house, no objects, players, or monsters can interact with you or the house.  You can leave customization mode by <a href = "?165">committing a new design</a>, or by <a href = "?164">saving your design for later</a>.  Committing a new design costs you money and requires you to manuall unpack the moving crate.  Saving a design for later restores the house to its former state.<BR><BR>Custom houses must obey certain <a href = "?163">structural support</a> rules.<BR><BR>While customizing a house, a special house building interface appears on your screen.  This interface has a multitude of options, listed here:<BR><BR><a href = "?157">Component Selection</a> (<a href = "?173">Walls</a>, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>);  <a href = "?155">Eraser</a>; <a href = "?154">Eyedropper</a>; <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> (<a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>); <a href = "?156">component and fixture counter</a>; <a href = "?146">component menu</a>; <a href = "?174">transparency selection</a> buttons; <a href = "?175">story selection</a> buttons; and <a href = "?167">cost</a> counter.;Original
1062135;COMPONENT MENU;Original
1062136;The center area of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> is where you select components to paint onto your house design.  Most <a href = "?157">categories</a> of components have multiple pages of items to choose from.  The arrow icons on the left and right edges of this menu allow you to switch between pages of available components.  From this menu, click a component, and you will enter paint mode with the selected component active.<BR><BR>When entering the <a href = "?173">walls</a> or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> categories, this area first shows a one-page list of subcategories.  Click a subcategory to browse the individual sets of components in that category.  When browsing a subcategory, an upward pointing arrow icon here allows you to return to the category list.<BR><BR>When in the walls category, this menu has an extra button that toggles windows on and off.  If you wish to place walls with built-in windows, click the window toggle.<BR><BR>In the <a href = "?159">doors</a> category, icons next to each door show which way the door opens.;Original
1062137;SYSTEM MENU;Original
1062138;The system menu button in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> shows several icons that allow you to change house modes and access additional features.  The buttons are:<BR><BR><a href = "?148">Synch</a>, <a href = "?149">Clear</a>, <a href = "?150">Backup</a>, <a href = "?151">Restore</a>, <a href = "?152">Commit</a>, <a href = "?153">Revert</a>.;Original
1062139;SYNCH;Original
1062140;While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, network conditions may cause your client to lose synchronization with the server.  Use this <a href = "?147">system menu</a> button to force a re-synchronization.  This completely resets your client's view of your house design to match the one on the server.;Original
1062141;CLEAR;Original
1062142;While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to simply erase your current design and start over.  Click the Clear button on the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> to erase your current design and start over with an empty dirt lot.  Note that this only clears your current in-progress design, and does not erase your active design or your <a href = "?150">saved</a> design.;Original
1062143;BACKUP;Original
1062144;Click the Backup button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to create a backup of your in-progress design.  Whenever you leave design mode without committing your new design, your in-progress design is automatically backedup.  Your house can only have one backed up design, so using this option overwrites your previous backup.  Use the <a href = "?151">restore</a> button to load your backed up design into your in-progress design.;Original
1062145;RESTORE;Original
1062146;Click the Restore button in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> to restore a previously <a href = "?150">backed up,</a> house design.  This does not affect your house's active design.;Original
1062147;COMMIT;Original
1062148;The Commit button is located in the <a href = "?147">system menu</a> of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  Click this button to finalize your in-progress design and make it your house's active design.  See <a href = "?165">committing a new house design</a> for more information.;Original
1062149;REVERT;Original
1062150;While <a href = "?145">customizing</a> your house, you may wish to replace your in-progress house design</a> with your current active design.  This is much like <a href = "?151">restoring</a> a design, except you are loading the last design you <a href = "?152">committed</a> rather than the last design you <a href = "?150">backed up</a>.;Original
1062151;EYEDROPPER;Original
1062152;The eyedropper tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to instantly select a <a href = "?146">component</a> already in your house design.  Click the Eraser icon, and target the component to copy.  The component menu switches to the page where the selected component can be found, and your cursor switches to painting mode with that component active.;Original

1062154;The eraser tool in the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> allows you to delete <a href = "?146">components</a> from your house design.  To erase components from your house design, click the Erase icon and target tiles to delete.  The tile to be deleted highlights red when your cursor is over it.  Click to erase the tile.  You cannot click and drag to delete multiple components.  You must single-click once for each tile to be deleted.;Original
1062155;COMPONENT AND FIXTURE COUNTER;Original
1062156;These numbers near the bottom of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a> display the number of components and number of fixtures in your house design.  Hovering your mouse over this counter brings up a small window showing more details.<BR><BR>Each fixture also counts as a component.  Fixtures are components that are interactive, and currently include <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.  Fixtures also count towards your house secure storage limit.  The number of fixtures allowed in a house design is limited.;Original
1062157;COMPONENT SELECTION;Original
1062158;On the left side of the <a href = "?145">house customization menu are nine buttons organized in three rows of three.  The first two rows open lists of components you can paint onto your house design.  To choose a component to paint, click the desired category and then select a component from the <a href = "?146">component menu.<B><B>The available categories of components are: <a href = "?173">Walls, <a href = "?158">Floors</a>, <a href = "?159">Doors</a>, <a href = "?160">Stairs</a>, <a href = "?161">Teleporters</a>, and <a href = "?162">Miscellaneous</a>.;Original
1062159;WALLS;Original
1062160;<a href = "?146">Components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  They are organized according to how they should be positioned in your house.  Use the V-shaped corner piece when two walls should to the south and east.  The smallest pieces here are the corner posts that join walls to the north and west.  The remaining wall pieces are north and east facing walls.  With a little practice, you'll get a good feel for how these pieces connect together.  Walls must be <a href = "?163">structurally supported</a> and if they are full-height they can provide support for floor components above them.<BR><BR>You may use the window toggle at the top of the component menu to select walls with built-in windows to place in your house design.;Original
1062161;FLOORS;Original
1062162;Floor <a href = "?146">components</a> are categorized in the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> by style.  Select the floor you wish to paint onto your house design.  If you wish to change floors that are hidden by walls, use the <a href = "?174">transparency buttons</a> to see behind them.  Floors provide <a href = "?163">structural support</a> for non-floor components positioned on top of them.;Original
1062163;DOORS;Original
1062164;Door <a href = "?146">components</a> are one type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  Simply choose the style of door from the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> you wish to paint on your house design.  Like <a href = "?173">walls</a>, doors require<a href = "?163"> structural support</a>, and can provide support for items above them.;Original
1062165;STAIRS;Original
1062166;Stair <a href = "?146">components</a> come in two types.  First are staircases, which serve to join different stories of your house.  The other type are front steps, which allow access to your foundation.  On the <a href = "?157">component menu</a> for the stairs category, staircases appear on the top row and front step components appear on the bottom row.<BR><BR>Staircases are multiple-tile components that have special properties.  They must have sufficient <a href = "?163">structural support</a>.  Furthermore, you cannot place <a href = "?158">floors</a> in the spaces above a staircase, because those floors would block movement up the staircase.<BR><BR>Front steps can only be placed along the south edge of your house's foundation.  Note that the house customization system will allow you to <a href = "?155">erase</a> all of your front steps.  If you do this, it will be impossible for anyone (including you) to enter your custom house.  Be careful to always create a way to get onto your house!;Original
1062167;TELEPORTERS;Original
1062168;Teleporter <a href = "?146">components</a> are a type of <a href = "?156">fixture</a> you can add to your house.  They are similar in most respects to <a href = "?158">floor</a> components, except that they provide an alternative means to move around in your custom house.<BR><BR>In order for a teleporter to be functional, it must link to one or more other teleporters.  Each teleporter component has a different symbol engraved in it.  To link teleporters, place multiple teleporters of the same symbol.  When you <a href = "?152">commit</a> your design, teleporters with matching symbols link up.<BR><BR>Stepping on one linked teleporter will move your avatar to another teleporter tile with the same symbol.  If there are only two teleporters in your house with the same symbol, stepping on one will always move you to the other.  If three or more teleporters share the same symbol, stepping on one will move you to one of the others with the same symbol, selected randomly.;Original
1062169;MISCELLANEOUS;Original
1062170;The miscellaneous <a href = "?146">component</a> category contains a selection of different tiles, including archways, battlements, columns, fences, and waterfalls.  Like most other components, these require <a href = "?163">structural support</a> and can provide structural support to other components.;Original
1062171;TRANSPARENCY SELECTION;Original
1062172;These controls allow you to change the visibility of walls and floors on different stories of the house, to make it easer to design around them.  Each of the buttons in this column correspond to one story of your house.  Each time you click the button, transparency settings move to the next setting in the cycle.  When you <a href = "?175">change stories</a>, all transparency settings are reset on all storied.;Original
1062173;STORY SELECTION;Original
1062174;To edit a different story of your house, use the buttons in the rightmost column on your house customization interface.  Each button corresponds to one story of your house.  Simply click a button to be transported to that story.  When you do this, <a href = "?174">transparency settings</a> for all stories are reset.;Original
1062175;STRUCTURAL SUPPORT;Original
1062176;Your custom house design must (to a certain degree) obey the laws of physics.  This means that you can't have floors floating on air and hovering columns.  Every <a href = "?146">component</a> in your house must be structurally supported.  Most components provide some form of structural support to other components.<BR><BR>Here is how it works:  There are two main types of structural support:  floors and walls.  Any tile in your house design that does not have valid structural support highlights orange.  You cannot <a href = "?165">commit</a> your house design while any tiles in it are not validly supported.<BR><BR><a href = "?158">Floor (and <a href = "?161">teleporter</a>) tiles must be supported by non-floor components on the story below.  Floor tiles on the first story of your house are considered supported by the foundation below them.  Any <a href = "?173">wall</a>, <a href = "?159">door</a>, or <a href = "?162">miscellaneous</a> component that is the full height of one story of your house can provide structural support for floor components above them.  Any floor tile directly on top of a supporting component is itself considered supported.  Any floor tile adjacent to a directly supported floor tile is also supported.  If you build a solid line of floor tiles between two directly supported tiles, all tiles in that line are validly supported.  Whenever you form a rectangle of supported floor tiles, all floor tiles in that rectangle are validly supported.<BR><BR>Non-floor components must obtain their structural support either from validly supported floors, or from adjacent non-floor items.  Any component that touches the ground can receive its support from a floor tile.  Some components (like parts of archways) do not touch the ground, and can only receive support from an adjacent component that is tall enough.  There is a limit to how far pieces can receive adjacent support.;Original
1062177;SAVING A DESIGN;Original
1062178;If you are not ready to <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, you can save it for later.  To do this, simply right-click the <a href = "?145">house customization menu</a>.  You will exit <a href = "?169">customization mode</a> and you can come back and work on your design again later.;Original
1062179;COMMITTING A NEW HOUSE DESIGN;Original
1062180;Once you are completed re-designing your house, you are ready to commit the design.  In order to do so, you must have funds in your bank (in the form of gold and/or checks) to cover the <a href = "?167">cost</a> of your new design.  (Note that if your new design has fewer components in it, you may receive a refund.)  Simply open the <a href = "?147">System Menu</a> in the <a href = "?145">house customization interface</a> and choose the <a href = "?XXX">Commit</a> option.  Once your confirm, your house will change to your new design.  Once you do this, you must check over the security settings on all your <a href = "?159">doors</a> and <a href = "?161">teleporters</a>.;Original
1062181;HOUSE VALUE;Original
1062182;Non-customizable houses have fixed costs.  The cost to place each house type is displayed on the house placement tool menu.  If you demolish a non-customizable house or covert it into a customizable one, you are refunded 90% of this amount (also referred to as the house value).;Original
1062183;CUSTOMIZATION COSTS;Original
1062184;The cost to commit a house design is based on the number of components in the house, including the foundation itself.  The current cost of a house is displayed in the lower-right corner of the house design menu.  When committing a new design, you are refunded 90% of the value of the old design and must pay the cost displayed.;Original
1062185;NORMAL MODE;Original
1062186;In normal mode, customizable houses behave just like any other house -- you can walk around on them or in them, store objects inside, and so forth.  See also:  <a href = "?169">customization mode</a>.;Original
1062187;CUSTOMIZATION MODE;Original
1062188;In Customization Mode, all access to the house is blocked except to the person customizing the house.  In this mode, all other players see the house as it was prior to entering customization mode, but hey cannot enter it or interact with it in any way.  The player actually customizing the house, however, can see and edit a new in-progress design.  When you are customizing a house, you are invisible and safe from attack.  You can walk through the walls of your house and walk on air without falling.  This allows you to change your house design conveniently and in perfect safety.  Note, however, that you cannot do anything else at all in this mode.  While customizing your house, you cannot open your backpack, use any objects, use any skills, speak to other players, or leave the house.  It is much like being a ghost.  See also: <a href = "?168">normal mode</a>.;Original
1062189;MOVING CRATE;Original
1062190;The house moving crate is a special container that holds your locked down items, secure containers, vendors, barkeepers, and house add-ons while you edit your house.  When you enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a>, your items are packed into the moving crate, which is hidden from view.<BR><BR>If you leave customization mode without committing a new design, your items are automatically unpacked from the moving mrate and restored to their previous position.  The only exception is house add-ons, which remain in deed form inside the moving crate.  You must manually replace these.<BR><BR>When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new design, items cannot be automatically unpacked from the moving crate.  You must instead <a href = "?171">unpack</a> these items yourself.;Original
1062191;UNPACKING;Original
1062192;When you <a href = "?165">commit</a> a new house design, items inside your <a href = "?170">moving crate</a> remain inside and hidden.  You must remove these items and position them in your house.  Vendors and barkeeps require <a href = "?172">special handling</a>.<BR><BR>The moving crate cannot be picked up, and you cannot put items inside.  Once you remove an item from the crate, you cannot put it back in.  Items inside the crate count toward your secure storage limit.  Items inside your moving crate are organized into sub-containers.<BR><BR>You can teleport your moving crate to the spot where you are standing at any time by opening your house sign menu, going to the CUSTOMIZATION page, and choosing <B>Relocate Moving Crate</B>.;Original
1062193;UNPACKING VENDORS AND BARKEEPS;Original
1062194;Vendors and barkeepers are invisible when they are inside a <a href = "?170">moving crate</a>.  In order to put them back to work, you must move to the desired location in your house.  Next, open the context-sensitive menu on your avatar and choose the Station Vendor option.  A menu listing all your vendors and barkeeps by name appears.  Select one.  If the place you are standing on is valid, the vendor or barkeep appears there and returns to work.;Original

1062196;HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION;Original
1062197;This feature allows you to create a truly unique home by laying out the floor plan and choosing building materials for the walls, floors, and other components.  In order to build or own a custom house, your account must be upgraded to <I>Ultima Online: Age of Shadows</I>.  Not all houses are customizable.  In order to build your own house, you need to obtain a customizable <a href = "?144">dirt lot</a> and sufficient <a href = "?167">funds</a> to pay for the customization.  Using your house sign, you will enter <a href = "?145">customization mode</a> and edit your house's design.  When you are ready, you can <a href = "?165">commit</a> your new design, making it visible for all the world to see.;Original
1062198;DIRT LOTS;Original
1062199;Dirt lots are a special type of house that can be <a href = "?143">customized</a>.  They are in most respects exactly like normal houses, except that only players who have upgraded to Ultima Online: Age of Shadows can own them.  There are three ways to obtain a dirt lot:  by <a href = "?135">placing</a> one, by <a href = "?140">buying</a> one, or by <a href = "?141">converting</a> a house into one.;Original

1062786;Thank you for participating in the character transfer program. In order to continue, you must indicate your understanding of the character transfer process by clicking the "Next" button. Complete details on this process can be found by pointing your Web browser at <a href="http://support.uo.com/charactertransfer.html">support.uo.com/charactertransfer.html</a>, but we would like to call special attention to the following points:<br>- Items eligible for transfer include your character, everything your character has equipped (both wearing and holding), your backpack, your bank box, all your stabled pets, all your character's pets within the immediate vicinity, and their associated contents. (Temporary "followers," such as hirelings, escorts, and animated dead, will not be transferred.)<br>- Please verify the contents of your character's "transfer crate" are correct before initiating the transfer to the new shard. You will not get another opportunity to do so, nor can items be added if you find them missing afterwards.<br>- Houses and their secured items will not be transferred.<br>- You will lose all affiliations to guilds, factions, and parties once the transfer is complete.<br>- Bracelets of Binding and Balls of Pet Summoning will have their links cleared upon transfer to the new shard.<br>- All legacy "house deeds" will be converted into house placement tools.<br>- You can cancel transfer at any point during the process, and resume at a later date.<br>- You will not be able to log into the original or destination shards until the transfer is complete.<br>- You will have to recreate any custom game macros for that character after the transfer to the new shard.<br>- After entering the new shard, <i>you will have 7 days to remove all items from your character's "transfer crate." </i>Any items that remain in the crate after that time will disappear forever. (You can access your transfer crate at any time by choosing the "Open Transfer Crate" option from the context menu on your character.);Original

1062911;Royal Leggings of Embers;Original
1062912;<body>When Britannia was founded, the king was attacked with a fire spell that nearly killed him. (Rumors of his demise were highly exaggerated.) Ever since, he kept a pair of Royal Leggings of Embers nearby.</body>;Original
1062913;Rose of Trinsic;Original
1062914;<body>In the second age of Britannia, the peaceful town of Trinsic was attacked by the forces of chaos. After a fierce, bloody battle, the town was overrun and destroyed. This rose commemorates the Honor of the Trinsic defenders.</body>;Original
1062915;Shamino’s Best Crossbow;Original
1062916;<body>Once a king of Sosaria, Shamino was one of Lord British’s greatest Companions. Hailing from the city of Skara Brae, known for its spiritual people, Shamino followed the life of a ranger and was perhaps the best marksman in the land. This crossbow design is one created especially for him by Iolo, his long-time companion.</body>;Original
1062917;The Tapestry of Sosaria;Original
1062918;<body>The history of the world is recorded in this tapestry, starting with the first days of Britannia to Third Dawn’s age of prosperity and opportunity. It was designed by one of Lord British’s most loyal companions, Iolo, a master bard and storyteller.</body>;Original
1062919;Hearth of the Home Fire;Original
1062920;<body>When Lord Blackthorn waged a dark campaign to steal control of Britannia, the citizens often stayed home at night, not daring to leave their homes. The good people of Britannia spent those cold nights huddled around the warmth of a blazing fireplace like this one.</body>;Original
1062921;The Holy Sword;Original
1062922;<body>The fifth age, known as the Age of Shadows, was a difficult one. Necromancers had learned to raise the dead from their graves, and holy Paladins joined ranks to wipe the dark art of Necromancy from the world. It is a struggle that still continues. Paladins, thanks to a blacksmith with arcane knowledge, now have the Holy Sword to help in their quest.</body>;Original
1062923;Ancient Samurai Helm;Original
1062924;<body>Strange items from a strange land are being found. Rumors abound of a new land with new warriors and new ways to wage war. If the rumors are true, Britannia might never be the same. This strange helm was brought back on a trade vessel. Its exotic beauty pales in the face of its durability.</body>;Original

1063023;<i>As you enter the courtyard you notice a faded sign. It reads: </i><br><br>Welcome to your new home, Samurai.<br><br> Though your skills are only a shadow of what they can be some day, you must prove your adherence to the code of the Bushido.<br><br>Seek Daimyo Haochi for guidance.<br><br><i>Will you accept the challenge?</i>;Original

1063028;<I>In case you change your mind later...</I><BR><BR>You may re-start this quest at any time while you are here. Simply return to Daimyo Haochi and speak with him. Once you travel to the city, you will not be able to return. <BR><BR>;Original
1063029;Greetings. I am Daimyo Haochi, the Feudal Lord of this region. <BR><BR>Since you are here at my side, you must wish to learn the ways of the Samurai.<BR><BR> Wielding a blade is easy, anyone can grasp a sword’s hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman.<BR><BR> Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here. <BR><BR>You will go through 7 trials to prove your adherence to the Samurai code. <BR><BR> The first trial will test your decision making skills. You only have to enter the area beyond the green passageway. <BR><BR>Do not attempt to hurry your trials. The guards will only let you through to each trial when I have deemed you ready.<br><br>As a last resort you may use the golden teleporter tiles in each trial area but do so at your own risk. You may not be able to return and complete your trials once you have chosen to escape.;Original
1063030;Follow the green path. The guards will now let you through.;Original
1063031;Beyond you are two troubled groups.<BR><BR> The Cursed Souls were once proud warriors that were ensorcelled by an evil mage. The mage trapped and killed them later but the spell has not lifted from their souls in death. <BR><BR>The Young Ronin were former Samurai in training who lost their way. They are loyal only to those with enough coin in their pocket. <BR><BR>You must decide who needs to be fought to the death. You may wish to <a href="?ForceTopic27">review combat techniques</a> as well as <a href = "?ForceTopic29">information on healing yourself</a>. <BR><BR>Return to Daimyo Haochi after you have finished with your trial.<br><br>If you should die during any of your trials, visit one of the Ankh Shrines and you will be resurrected. You should retrieve your belongings from your body before returning to the Daimyo or you may not be able to return to your corpse.;Original
1063032;Kill 3 Young Ronin or 3 Cursed Souls. Return to Daimyo Haochi when you have finished.;Original
1063033;To view the surrounding area, you should learn about the Radar Map.<BR><BR>The Radar Map (or Overhead View) can be opened by pressing 'ALT-R' on your keyboard. It shows your immediate surroundings from a bird's eye view.<BR><BR>Pressing ALT-R twice, will enlarge the Radar Map a little. Use the Radar Map often as you travel throughout the world to familiarize yourself with your surroundings.;Original

1063044;The first trial is complete. Return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original
1063045;It is good that you rid the land of the Cursed Souls so they can be at peace in death. They had been cursed for doing what they thought was an honorable deed. Now they can have respect in their death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack. <BR><BR>The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.;Original
1063046;It is good that you rid the land of those dishonorable Samurai. Perhaps they will learn a greater lesson in death.<BR><BR> I have placed a reward in your pack.<BR><BR> The second trial will test your courage. You only have to follow the yellow path to see what awaits you.;Original

1063055;You are now ignoring guild invitations.;Original
1063056;You have joined ~1_val~.;Original
1063057;Beyond the guards is a test of courage.  You must face your fear and attack a great beast. You must choose which beast to slay for there is more than one beyond the courtyard doors. <BR><BR>The imp entered the courtyard unaware of its surroundings. The dragon came knowingly, hunting for the flesh of humans – A feast for the beast. <BR><BR>You must rid the courtyard of these beasts but you may only choose one to attack. Go and choose wisely.;Original
1063058;Choose your opponent and attack one with all your skill.;Original
1063059;Fear remains in your eyes but you have learned that not all is what it appears to be. <BR><BR>You must have known the dragon would slay you instantly. You elected the weaker opponent though the imp did not come here to destroy. You have much to learn. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path.;Original
1063060;You faced the dragon knowing it would be your certain death. That is the courage of a Samurai. <BR><BR>Your spirit speaks as a Samurai already. <BR><BR>In these lands, death is not forever. The shrines can make you whole again as can a helpful mage or healer. <BR><BR>Seek them out when you have been mortally wounded. <BR><BR>The next trial will test your benevolence. You only have to walk the blue path. ;Original
1063061;The next trial will test your benevolence. Follow the blue path. The guards will now let you through.;Original
1063062;A pack of wolves circle your feet. They have been injured and are in pain. A quick death will end their suffering.<br><br>Use your Honorable Execution skill or other means to finish off a wounded wolf. Do so and return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original
1063063;Use your Honorable Execution skill to finish off the wounded wolf. Double click the icon in your Book of Bushido to activate the skill. When you are done, return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original
1063064;Return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original
1063065;<I>Daimyo Haochi smiles as you walk up to him. Quietly he says:</I><BR><BR> A Samurai understands the need to help others even as he wields a blade against them. <BR><BR>You have shown compassion. A true Samurai is benevolent even to an enemy. For this you have been rewarded. <BR><BR>And now you must prove yourself again. Walk the red path.  We will talk again later.;Original
1063066;Follow the red path and pass through the guards to the entrance of the fourth trial.;Original
1063067;<I>You approach a disheveled gypsy standing near a small shed. You sense that she has not eaten nor bathed in quite some time. <BR><BR>Around her is a large colony of mangy and diseased cats. It appears she has spent what little money she’s earned to feed the cats instead of herself. <BR><BR>You have a decision to make. You can give her gold so she can buy some food for her animals and herself. You can also remove the necessity of the extra mouths to feed so she may concentrate on saving herself.</i><br><br>If you elect to give the gypsy money, you can do so by clicking your stack of gold and selecting ‘1’. Then dragging it and dropping it on the Gypsy.;Original
1063068;Give the gypsy gold or hunt one of the cats to eliminate the undue need it has placed on the gypsy.;Original
1063069;The wolves no longer need your assistance.;Original
1063070;You showed respect by helping another out while allowing the gypsy what little dignity she has left. <BR><BR>Now she will be able to feed herself and gain enough energy to walk to her camp. <BR><BR>The cats are her family members– cursed by an evil mage. <BR><BR>Once she has enough strength to walk back to the camp, she will be able to undo the spell. <BR><BR>You have been rewarded for completing your trial. And now you must prove yourself again. <BR><BR>Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.;Original
1063071;Respect comes from allowing another to make their own decisions. By denying the gypsy her animals, you negate the respect she is due. Perhaps you will have learned something to use next time a similar situation arises. <BR><BR> And now you must prove yourself again. Please retrieve my katana from the treasure room and return it to me.;Original
1063072;Retrieve Daimyo Haochi’s katana from the treasure room.;Original
1063073;Give the sword to Daimyo Haochi. ;Original
1063074;What? You have returned without the sword? Go back and look for it again.;Original
1063075;I saw you drop the sword earlier. Take care not to lose it this time.;Original
1063076;Thank you for returning this sword to me and leaving the remaining treasure alone. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete. Before you have your final trial, you should pay homage to Samurai who came before you.  <BR><BR>Go into the Altar Room and light a candle for them. Afterwards, return to me.;Original
1063077;I thank you for returning this sword. However, you should admonished for also taking treasure that was not asked for nor given back.  <BR><BR>Think about your actions youngling. <BR><BR>Your training is nearly complete. Before you have your final trial, you should pay homage to Samurai who came before you.  <BR><BR>Go into the Altar Room and light a candle for them. Afterwards, return to me.;Original
1063078;Light one of the candles near the altar and return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original
1063079;You have done well young Samurai. There is but one thing left to do. <BR><BR>In the final room is the holding cell containing young Ninjas who came to take my life. They were caught and placed in my custody. <BR><BR>Take care of these miscreants and show them where your loyalty lies. <BR><BR>This is your final act as a Samurai in training.;Original
1063080;Three young Ninja must be dealt with. Your job is to kill them. When you have done so, return to Daimyo Haochi.;Original

1072042;The caster and up to four participating arcanists (all within 20 spellweaving skill of each other) must stand inside an arcane circle, pentagram or abbatoir. When the caster invokes this spell, a magically charged emerald (called an arcane focus) is created for the caster and each participating arcanist. The arcane focus increases duration, spell damage, healing spell effectiveness, and area of effect for the activator’s Spellweaving spells.;Original
1072043;The arcanist taps into the regenerative forces of nature to deliver healing pulses for the duration of the spell.;Original
1072044;Temporarily enchants a melee weapon to inflict extra fire damage per hit.;Original
1072045;The arcanist attunes their life force, granting them a temporary ability to absorb physical damage.;Original
1072046;A thunderous boom that temporarily smites opponents with energy damage and possibly reduces spellcasting recovery time.;Original
1072047;Summons a swarm of insects that inflict poison damage upon its victim. The more it is angered, the more damage it inflicts.;Original
1072048;Summons a lesser fey to fight, follow, and guard the arcanist.;Original
1072049;Summons a lesser fiend to fight, follow, and guard the arcanist.;Original
1072050;Transforms the caster into a reaper that provides bonuses to swing speed, spell damage, and resists. However, while in this form, the caster is susceptible to Fire and moves at a slower speed.;Original
1072051;A blast of intense heat that distributes fire damage to all opponents within its area of effect. Lasts for several seconds.;Original
1072052;A blast of cold air that inflicts cold damage to all enemies within its area of effect. Enemies attack and cast spells slower while under this spell’s chill effect. Chill effect lasts for several seconds.;Original
1072053;The arcanist may assume a dryad's allure and charm humanoids (but not players) to temporarily serve their will.;Original
1072054;Allows the arcanist to wander around in an ethereal form as if under the effects of monster ignore.  Effect ends after the duration expires or when the caster performs a hostile action (whichever comes first). The arcanist is still visible to other player characters and may be attacked by other player characters as normal. Cannot be used during the heat of battle.;Original

1072263;Psst!  Hey ... psst!  Listen, I need some help here but it's gotta be hush hush.  I don't want THEM to know I'm onto them.  They watch me.  I've seen them, but they don't know that I know what I know.  You know?  Anyway, I need you to scare them off by killing a few of them.

1072574;Well now that Moug-Guur is no more -- and I can't say I'm weeping for his demise -- it's time for the ratmen to experience a similar loss of leadership.  Slay Chiikkaha.  In return, I'll satisfy your greed temporarily.;Original
1072575;Alright, if you'd rather not, then run along and do whatever worthless things you do when I'm not giving you direction.;Original
1072576;How difficult is this?  The rats live in the tunnels.  Go into the tunnels and find the biggest, meanest rat and execute him.  Loitering around here won't get the task done.;Original
1072577;It's about time!  Could you have taken longer?;Original
1072578;Hmm, maybe you aren't entirely worthless.  I suspect a demoness of Szavetra's calibre will tear you apart ...  We might as well find out.  Kill the succubus, yada yada, and you'll be richly rewarded. ;Original

1072707;*sigh*  We have so much to do to clean this area up.  Even the fine work you did on those ogres didn't have much of an impact on the community.  It's the ogre lords that direct the actions of the other ogres, let's strike at the leaders and perhaps that will thwart the miserable curs.;Original
1072708;Reluctance doesn't become a hero like you.  But, as you wish.;Original
1072709;Ogre Lords are pretty easy to recognize.  They're the ones ordering the other ogres about in a lordly manner.  Striking down their leadership will throw the ogres into confusion and dismay!;Original
1072710;Inconceiveable!  We've learned that the ogre leadership has recruited some heavy-duty guards to their cause.  I've never personally fought a cyclopian warrior, but I'm sure you could easily best a few and report back how much trouble they'll cause to our growing community?;Original
1072711;Oh, I see.  *sigh*  Perhaps I overestimated your abilities.;Original
1072712;Make sure you fully assess all of the cyclopian tactical abilities!;Original
1072713;The ogre insurgency has taken a turn for the worse!  I've just been advised that the titans have concluded their discussions with the ogres and they've allied.  We have virtually no information about titans.  Engage them and appraise their mettle.;Original
1072714;Certainly.  You've done enough to merit a breather.  When you're ready for more, report back to me.;Original

And, of course, you'll take this application and have it notarized by Sarakki the Notary.  Until you've become an official friend of the library, I can't allow you to make donations.  It wouldn't be proper.;Original

1072761;Learning to weave spells and control the forces of nature requires sacrifice, discipline, focus, and an unwavering dedication to Sosaria herself.  We do not teach the unworthy.  They do not comprehend the lessons nor the dedication required.  If you would walk the path of the Arcanist, then you must do as I require without hesitation or question.  Your first task is to rid our home of rats ... 50 of them in the next hour.;Original

They do not comprehend the lessons nor the dedication required.  If you would walk the path of the Arcanist, then you must do as I require without hesitation or question.  Your first task is to gather miniature mushrooms ... 20 of them from the branches of our mighty home.  I give you one hour to complete the task.;Original
1072763;The way of the Arcanist involves cooperation with others and a strong committment to the community of your people.  We have run low on the cotton we use to pack wounds and our people have need.  Bring 10 bales of cotton to me.;Original
1072764;We must look to the defense of our people!  Bring boards for new arrows.;Original
1072765;With health and defense assured, we need look to the need of the community for food and drink.  We will feast on fish steaks, sweets, and wine.  You will supply the ingredients, the cooks will prepare the meal.  As a Arcanist relies upon others to build focus and lend their power to her workings, the community needs the effort of all to survive.;Original
1072766;You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.  The human vermin that have spread as a disease, despoiling the land are the greatest blight we face.  Kill humans and return to me the proof of your actions. Bring me 30 human ears.;Original

1072770;Do not falter now.  You have begun to show promise.;Original

1072773;You waste my time.  The task is simple. Kill 50 rats in an hour.;Original
1072774;The mushrooms I seek can be found growing here in The Heartwood. Seek them out and gather them.  You are running out of time.;Original

1072780;You have proven your desire to contribute to the community and serve the people.  Now you must demonstrate your willingness to defend Sosaria from the greatest blight that plagues her.

1072962;What's that? *alarmed gasp*  Do not speak of the Black Order so loudly, they might hear and take offense.  *whispers*  I collect the badges of their sects, if you wish to seek them out and slay them.  Bring five of each and I will reward you.;Original
1072963;I have a task for you ... adventurer.  Will you risk all to win great renown?  The Black Order is organized into three sects, each with their own speciality.  The Dragon's Flame serves the will of the Grand Mage, the Tiger's Claw answers to the Master Thief, and the Serpent's Fang kills at the direction of the High Executioner.  Slay all three and you will strike the order a devastating blow!;Original
1072964;We believe the Black Order has fallen under the sway of Minax, somehow.  Seek evidence that proves our theory by piercing the secrets of the Citadel.;Original
1072965;You have discovered a bundle of stolen property.  Will you return it to its rightful owner?;Original
1072966;The Dragon's Flame sect members have gone too far!  Express to them my displeasure by slaying ten of them.  But remember, I do not condone war on women, so I will only accept the deaths of men, human or elf.  Either race will do, I care not for the shape of their ears.  Yes, this action will properly make clear my disapproval and has a pleasing harmony.;Original
1072967;I wish to make a statement of censure against the elite ninjas of the Black Order.  Deliver, in the strongest manner, my disdain.  But do not make war on women, even those that take arms against you.  It is not ... fitting.;Original

1072972;*whisper* The Citadel entrance is disguised as a fishing village.  The magical portal into the stronghold itself is moved frequently.  You'll need to search for it.;Original
1072973;I do not fault your decision.;Original
1072974;Once you gain entrance into The Citadel, you will need to move cautiously to find the sect leaders.;Original
1072975;Many fear to tangle with the wicked sorceress.  I understand and appreciate your concerns.;Original
1072976;I don't know where inside The Citadel such evidence could be found.  Perhaps the most guarded sanctum is the place to look.;Original
1072977;Of course, you could also choose to keep the bundle.;Original

1073035;A gorilla once bit my sister.  No, really.  So, I'm on a crusade to have the filthy beasts destroyed once and for all.  Kill eight of them and I'll make it worth your while.;Original

1073559;You attempt to recover ~1_NUM~ ~2_AMMO~, but there is no room in your backpack, and they are lost.;Original
1073560;In memory of Mordanna;Original
1073561;Can you hear them? The never-ending howling? The incessant wailing? These banshees, they never cease! Never! They haunt my nights. Please, I beg you -- will you silence them? I would be ever so grateful. ;Original
1073562;Some say killing a boggling brings good luck. I don't place much stock in old wives' tales, but I can say a few dead bogglings would certainly be lucky for me! Help me out and I can reward you for your efforts. ;Original
1073563;Nobody told me about the Mummy's Curse. How was I supposed to know you shouldn't disturb the tombs? Oh, sure, now all I hear about is the curse of the vengeful dead. I'll tell you what -- make a few of these mummies go away and we'll keep this between you and me.;Original
1073564;You want to hear about trouble? I got trouble. How's angry piles of granite walking around for trouble? Maybe they don't like the mining, maybe it's the farming. I don't know. All I know is someone's got to turn them back to potting soil. And it'd be worth a pretty penny to the soul that does it.;Original
1073565;Please, hear me kind traveler. You know when a knight falls, sometimes they are cursed to roam the earth as undead mockeries of their former glory? That is too grim a fate for even any knight to suffer! Please, put them out of their misery. I will offer you what payment I can if you will end the torment of these undead wretches. ;Original
1073566;It is a piteous thing when the dead continue to walk the earth. Restless spirits are known to inhabit these parts, taking the lives of unwary travelers. It is about time a hero put the dead back in their graves. I'm sure such a hero would be justly rewarded.;Original
1073567;Imps! Do you hear me? Imps! They're everywhere! They're in everything! Oh, don't be fooled by their size -- they vicious little devils! Half-sized evil incarnate, they are! Somebody needs to send them back to where they came from, if you know what I mean. ;Original
1073568;The Terathan are an aggressive species. Left unchecked, they will swarm across our lands. And where will that leave us? Compost in the hive, that's what! Stop them, stop them cold my friend. Kill their warriors and you'll check their movement, that is certain.;Original
1073569;I've seen them hiding in their webs among the woods. Glassy eyes, spindly legs, poisonous fangs. Monsters, I say! Deadly horrors, these black widows. Someone must exterminate the abominations! If only I could find a worthy hero for such a task, then I could give them this considerable reward.;Original
1073570;Why must the dead plague the living? With their foul necromancy and dark sorceries, the undead menace the countryside. I fear what will happen if no one is strong enough to face these nightmare sorcerers and thin their numbers.;Original
1073571;Foul brutes! No one loves an orc, but some of them are worse than the rest. Their Captains and their Bombers, for instance, they're the worst of the lot. Kill a few of those, and the rest are just a rabble. Exterminate a few of them and you'll make the world a sunnier place, don't you know. ;Original
1073572;Thank goodness, a hero like you has arrived! Brigands have descended upon this area like locusts, stealing and looting where ever they go. We need someone to put these vile curs where they belong -- in their graves. Are you up to the task? ;Original
1073573;A Solen hive is a fascinating piece of ecology. It's put together like a finely crafted clock. Who knows what happens if you remove something? So let's find out. Exterminate a few of the warriors and I'll make it worth your while.;Original
1073574;Kind traveler, hear my plea. You know of the evil orbs? The wrathful eyes? Some call them gazers? They must be a nest nearby, for they are tormenting us poor folk. We need to drive back their numbers. But we are not strong enough to face such horrors ourselves, we need a true hero. ;Original
1073575;Vermin! They get into everything! I told the boy to leave out some poisoned cheese -- and they shot him. What else can I do? Unless…these ratmen are skilled with a bow, but I'd lay a wager you're better, eh? Could you skin a few of the wretches for me?;Original
1073576;The woods in these parts are restless. Wrathful trees, walking about. Why, they're a menace to decent folk! And I'm running low on firewood, so what do you say? Could you turn a few reapers into some useful lumber?;Original
1073577;Were you the sort of child that enjoyed knocking over anthills? Well, perhaps you'd like to try something a little bigger? There's a Solen nest nearby and I bet if you killed a queen or two, it would be quite the sight to behold.  I'd even pay to see that -- what do you say? ;Original
1073578;It makes no sense! Cold blooded serpents cannot live in the ice! It's a biological impossibility! They are an abomination against reason! Please, I beg you -- kill them! Make them disappear for me! Do this and I will reward you. ;Original
1073579;The universe is all about balance my friend. Tip one end, you must balance the other. That's why I must ask you to kill not just one kind of elemental, but three kinds. Snuff out some Fire, douse a few Water, and crush some Earth elementals and I'll pay you for your trouble.;Original
1073580;I hope you'll reconsider. Until then, farwell.;Original
1073581;Until you kill 12 Wailing Banshees, there will be no peace. ;Original
1073582;Go back and kill all 20 bogglings!;Original
1073583;Uh, I don't think you're quite done killing Mummies yet. <br>;Original
1073584;You got rocks in your head? I said to kill 12 earth elementals, okay?<br>;Original
1073585;Your task is not done. Continue putting the Skeleton and Bone Knights to rest.<br>;Original
1073586;The restless spirts still walk -- you must kill 15 of them.;Original
1073587;Don't let the little devils scare you! You  kill 12 imps -- then we'll talk reward.<br>;Original
1073588;Unless you kill at least 10 Terathan Warriors, you won't have any impact on their hive.<br>;Original
1073589;You've got a good start, but to stop the black-eyed fiends, you need to kill a dozen. <br>;Original
1073590;Surely, a brave soul like yourself can kill 10 Bone Magi and Skeletal Mages?<br>;Original
1073591;The only good orc is a dead orc -- and 4 dead Captains and 6 dead Bombers is even better!<br>;Original
1073592;The Brigands still plague us. Have you killed 20 of their number?<br>;Original
1073593;I don't think you've gotten their attention yet -- you need to kill at least 10 Solen Warriors.<br>;Original
1073594;Have you annihilated a dozen Gazers yet, kind traveler?<br>;Original
1073595;I don't see 10 tails from Ratman Archers on your belt -- and until I do, no reward for you.<br>;Original
1073596;I'm thinking of building a small shed and the lumber of 15 reapers would be just about right.<br>;Original
1073597;Dead Solen Queens isn't too much to ask, is it?;Original
1073598;You wouldn't try and just pretend you murdered 10 Giant Ice Worms, would you?<br>;Original
1073599;Four of each, that's all I ask. Water, earth and fire. <br>;Original
1073600;Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.;Original
1073601;Finally, some peace and quiet! You've more than earned this reward.;Original
1073602;Well, I don't feel any luckier, but there's sure a lot less bogglings about. Good job, my friend.<br>;Original
1073603;Nice work. Now, here's something for your trouble -- and this will stay between you and me, right?<br>;Original
1073604;Well, you're turned them rocky horrors into gravel, didn't you? You've got my thanks -- and this reward.<br>;Original
1073605;You've done a noble deed, putting these undead down. I only wish I could give you a greater reward than this.<br>;Original
1073606;The spirits are now at peace. Please, take this as a reward for your work.<br>;Original
1073607;Oh, I hope those little buggers are burning where you sent 'em! Here's a little something to fill out your purse.<br>;Original
1073608;My friend, take this reward for your work in driving back the Terathan hive.<br>;Original
1073609;I haven't seen a single web since you cleared the area. You've more than earned this.<br>;Original
1073610;Pleace accept this modest offer for your bravery in facing those undead sorcerers.<br>;Original
1073611;Mmm. Smells like dead orc, out there! Nicely turned! Fatten your purse with this, then!<br>;Original
1073612;You've brought a measure of peace to this area. Please, accept this meager offering as reward.<br>;Original
1073613;It's fascinating to watch the nest in action, isn't it? Here's something for your trouble.<br>;Original
1073614;I no longer feel their prying gaze of evil upon me. For that, I give thanks to you -- here's is your reward.<br>;Original
1073615;Hmm, looks like you've built the better rat-trap. Enjoy a little reward then!<br>;Original
1073616;Yes, I like these woods much better without the trees wandering about. Nice job. <br>;Original
1073617;Did you seem them run around? Wasn't that great? Here, take this reward -- that’s the most fun I've had in days.<br>;Original
1073618;I think Giant Ice Worms are a myth, don't you? Shh, I don't want to talk about it -- just take the money and be gone.;Original

1073694;I must implore you, brave traveler, to do battle with the vile reptiles which haunt these parts. Those hideous abominations, the Ophidians, are a blight across the land. If you were able to put down a host of the scaly warriors, the Knights or the Avengers, I would forever be in your debt.;Original
1073695;There's been a bumper crop of evil with the Bog Things in these parts, my friend. Though they are foul creatures, they are also most fecund. Slay one and you make the land more fertile. Even better, slay several and I will give you whatever coin I can spare. ;Original
1073696;Psst. Listen close my friend, for I'll not speak of this again. Unicorns. You know them, I know them. I need a number of them gone. Don't ask why something you beautiful needs to be destroyed. If you can manage the task, I have the means to reward you handsomely. ;Original
1073697;It is regretable that the Gargoyles insist upon warring with us. Their Enforcers attack men on sight, despite all efforts at reason. To help maintain order in this region, I have been authorized to encourage bounty hunters to reduce their numbers. Eradicate their number and I will reward you handsomely.;Original
1073698;You think you've seen destruction and horror, my friend? You haven't seen anything until you've seen what a Giant Beetle can do a nicely tilled garden. There's been a swarm of 'em lately. I don't have much, but if you could rid the area of a few, I'm sure I could find something to reward you with.;Original
1073699;If I had but one wish, it would be to rid myself of these dread Efreet! Fire and ash, they are cunning and deadly! You look a brave soul --would you be interested in earning a rich reward for slaughtering a few of the smoky devils?;Original
1073700;Is there anything more foul than a pixie? They have cruel eyes and a mind for mischief, I say. I don't care if some think they're cute -- I say kill them and let the Avatar sort them out. In fact, if you were to kill a few pixies, I'd make sure you had a few coins to rub together, if you get my meaning.;Original
1073701;They aren't called Dread Spiders because they're fluffy and cuddly now, are they? No, there's nothing appealing about those wretches so I sure wouldn't lose any sleep if you were to exterminate a few. I'd even part with a generous amount of gold, I would.;Original
1073702;Feel that chill in the air? It means an icy death for the unwary, for deadly Ice Elementals are about. Who knows what magic summoned them, what's important now is getting rid of them. I don't have much, but I'll give all I can if you'd only stop the cold-hearted monsters.;Original
1073703;I should be trimming back the vegetation here, but something nasty has taken root. Viscious vines I can't go near. If there's any hope of getting things under control, some one's going to need to destroy a few of those Whipping Vines. Someone strong and fast and tough. ;Original
1073704;Ants are industrious and Lions are noble so who'd think an Ant Lion would be such a problem? The Ant Lion's have been causing mindless destruction in these parts. I suppose it's just how ants are. But I need you to help eliminate the infestation. Would you be willing to help for a bit of reward?<br>;Original
1073705;They're unholy, I say. Golems, a walking mockery of all life, born of blackest magic. They're not truly alive, so destroying them isn't a crime, it's a service. A service I will gladly pay for.;Original
1073706;It baffles me how a Ratman can be smart enough to learn magic. But, I don't think they're so smart you couldn't kill a few. The beady-eyed fiends have been causing trouble in these parts, so I'd be glad to reward someone who thinned their numbers.;Original
1073707;The flap of their leathery wings, the scratch of their reptillian claws, the clank of their scales. Keep your eyes open, friend for there are Drakes in these parts. The unwary find themselves a hot meal for the cold blooded fiends. I'd give all the treasure I possess to anyone brave enough to scourge a number of those devils from our fair skies.;Original
1073708;From the foul depths, the Kraken come to torment men. The scaly horrors make life near impossible for us all. I know it may not be much, but I'd gladly reward any who were fearless enough to face the Kraken and reduce their host!;Original
1073709;I have a business proposition for you, my friend. Caravans would like to move freely across our fair deserts except the accursed Sand Vortexes always attack them. If you could, say "disenchant" a few Vortexes, I could compensate you for your efforts in encouraging free trade. ;Original
1073710;These demon horses mock the bond between rider and steed! It pains me to see such despicable monsters in the shape of a noble horse. Please, execute these unholy mockeries, the Nightmares or the Fire Steeds, for me -- do this, and I will gladly reward you.;Original
1073711;You've heard of a snake in the grass? How about a serpent in a lava field? Those fiery monsters cause no end of trouble, slithering and burning. Find a way to turn a few lava serpents into charcoal and I'll make sure you leave with a heavy purse.;Original
1073712;Those frosty brutes! It's impossible to make a decent bonfire with them about! I'm talking about those masters of ice magic, the Arctic Ogre Lords. Yes, I'd certainly add a few coins to the purse of anyone tough enough to turn a few of those brutes into ice cubes!;Original
1073713;Devils of snow and ice! They steal the warmth from our very souls! If only someone were brave enough to face the dread Ice Fiends and reduce their numbers, then decent folk might have a chance for once!;Original
1073714;From the Stygian depths, the Daemons rise to torment poor humankind! I've seen them, cutting a swath of destruction through our fair land. But you, you seem a hardy adventurous sort. Perhaps you have experience in slaying foul daemons?;Original
1073715;Corpulent foul-smelling brutes! Without their leaders, you're average ogre is such a menace. But as long as the Ogre Lords are around, they whip that unsightly rabble into shape. Hmm, makes you think we should target a few of these Orge Lords, doesn't it?;Original
1073716;They watching me! Shh! They might hear! They've had their eyes on me for a while -- no, I'm not paranoid! Have you seen the way they look at me? Elder Gazers, indeed! Why do they observe me so? Please, kind traveler -- kill the fiends! Close their never-blinking eyes once and for all and I will gladly reward you!;Original
1073717;My dear old mum, she does hate those awful Terathan. She'd like nothing better than to wreck their hives. Hmm, you know -- kill a Terathan Matriarch and the hive drops in efficiency. I wonder…perhaps someone who targeted a few Terathan Matriarchs would do some damage to the Hive. That'd sure make my old mum proud....;Original
1073718;To live among giants is no easy task my friend. Take these Titans. Their appetites are prodigious, indeed. They consume all in their path trying to placate their enormous hunger! It leaves precious little for us to feed ourselves. I may not be wealthy, but if someone could kill a few Titans, I could afford to be generous with them.;Original
1073719;You've probably slain your fair share of the common orc, eh? Orcs are a dime a dozen, but the Orc Brute -- that's a different story entirely! They're hideous monsters who've earned their deaths a dozen times over! How about giving the lumpen oafs the death they so richly deserve?;Original
1073720;Does it seem uncommonly warm here? I think it does. I've seen Fire Gargoyles nearby. Those burning wretches turn to ash everything they touch. Do you know what does for property values? Do us all a favor and fight fire with fire -- kill some Fire Gargoyles for me.;Original
1073721;Beware the White Wyrm, my friend! They are not a beast to be triffled with. I've seen them gut villages and swallow peasants whole! My hatred for the albino atrocities runs deep -- so deep, I'd give all that I own to rid the land of them. ;Original
1073722;Did you know Poison Elementals are corrupted from the very air? They are miserable wretches, cursed by foul magic. You do them a favor by destroying the noxious creatures -- they'd surely thank you, though you might not notice it for them trying to kill you. But, I could find it in my heart to reward you for killing poison elementals.;Original
1073723;There is no greater foe than the mighty Dragon! A creature of myth and legend! A hero proves his worth by slaughtering the reptillian fiends! What? You're not swayed by my words? Well, would you be interested in a cash reward for killing dragons then?;Original
1073724;Death all around us, like a plague of, uh, pestilence! Those undead magicians, the Liches, torment the living! And their masters, the Lich Lords are the worst of the bunch. I'll tell you, I'd give this large treasure pile to anyone who cleared these undead monsters!;Original
1073725;Their girly bits are…exposed! There, out in the open, for any child to see! A succubus is an afront to all decency and morality! Someone needs to stand up for the children! Someone needs to teach the succubi a lesson in deceny!;Original
1073726;The Gargoyles think they're the superior race! Their Destroyers are the pinnacle of their warriors! But I know, humans are deadlier by far and I'll pay you to prove it to the red-skinned wretches!;Original
1073727;The Lords of the Underworld have grown bold! They march across the land, terrorizing and rampaging! But without their leaders, the Balrons, the legions of the nether realsm aren't nearly the threat. I could reward you handsomely if you could cut the head off of a demon army or two.;Original
1073728;Oh, the cruel irony! A hero slays a dragon, only for it to come back as an undead monstrosity thanks to black magic. These Skeletal Wyrms are twice the fiend they ever were in life and it will take twice the hero to put them down again! ;Original
1073729;They say the Serpentine Dragons hail from far off lands. Well, that's just wrong. I mean, what, are native dragons supposed to compete with cheap foreign dragons? It's not fair! I think somebody should do something about it!;Original
1073730;Every undead horror was once a living soul. Can you imagine, the poor wretches who become Rotting Corpses? What if some part of them knows what they've become? It's too horrible! Someone should return them to the ground.;Original
1073731;The older a wyrm gets, the more deadly and cunning. The Ancient Wyrms are a treacherous breed, each one soaked in the blood of innocents. A hero needs to right their wrongs, eradicate their evil from fair Britannia.;Original
1073732;Here's a riddle for you. Why hasn't anyone killed those annoying Sphinxes? With their puzzles and enigmatic ways, why we'd be better off without 'em all. In fact, I'll put my money where my mouth is -- kill Sphinxes and I'll reward you well.;Original
1073733;Perhaps you'll change your mind and return at some point.;Original
1073734;If you decide to return, I'll be waiting here.;Original
1073735;Have you killed the Ophidian Knights or Avengers?;Original
1073736;Continue to seek and kill the Bog Things.;Original
1073737;There's still too many unicorns around, if you catch my drift.;Original
1073738;I won't be able to pay you until you've gotten enough Gargoyle Enforcers.;Original
1073739;Did you forget to kill Giant Beetles?;Original
1073740;Those smoky devils, the Efreets, are still about.;Original
1073741;There's too much cuteness in the world -- kill those pixies!;Original
1073742;Dread Spiders? I say keep exterminating the arachnid vermin.;Original
1073743;The chill won't lift until you eradicate a few Ice Elemenals.;Original
1073744;How are farmers supposed to work with these Whipping Vines around?;Original
1073745;Please, rid us of the Ant Lion infestation.;Original
1073746;The unholy brutes, the Golems, must be smited!;Original
1073747;I think someone should skin a few ratmen mages, eh?;Original
1073748;A drake's almost a dragon but I still think you can take 'em.;Original
1073749;Please, help stop the Kraken menace.;Original
1073750;These Sand Vortexes make life impossible!;Original
1073751;Don't let the Nightmares or Fire Steeds continue to walk this earth.;Original
1073752;Those fiery serpents are still too many.;Original
1073753;There's more Arctic Ogre Lords to kill, I'm sure of that.;Original
1073754;I'm sure you can kill a few more Ice Fiends than that.;Original
1073755;The Daemon hordes still need to be thinned.;Original
1073756;Please, continue to battle the Ogre Lords.;Original
1073757;What are you looking at? Go kill Elder Gazers!;Original
1073758;Mum will be disappointed if you don't kill more Terathan Matriarchs.;Original
1073759;I hope you haven't had your fill of killing Titans.;Original
1073760;There's plenty more Orc Brutes who need killing.;Original
1073761;Do not lose hope, you can face more Fire Gargoyles, I am certain.;Original
1073762;The White Wyrms still trouble this land!;Original
1073763;I beseech you, put more Poison Elementals out of their misery.;Original
1073764;Prove you’re a hero -- kill some more Dragons!;Original
1073765;Lich Lords still haunt our fair lands.;Original
1073766;Do the decent thing and kill those horrible succubi!;Original
1073767;There are plenty more Gargoyle Destroyers to, uh, destroy.;Original
1073768;Balrons cannot be allowed to walk on the earth. Keep fighting them, please!;Original
1073769;Reduce a few more Skeletal Wyrms to a pile of bones.;Original
1073770;You've made a good start but those Serpentine Dragons need to be taught a lesson.;Original
1073771;I can still smell the foul decay of Rotting Corpses. ;Original
1073772;Fight the Ancient Wyrms, please!;Original
1073773;Please, do no rest until those Sphinxes are properly schooled!<br>;Original
1073774;You have finished your quest and may return for a reward.;Original
1073775;Your quest is complete. Return for your reward.;Original
1073776;We can all rest a little easier with less of those slithery Ophidians about. You've earned this reward.;Original
1073777;The land appreciates your efforts with the Bog Things. We should have a bumper crop this year!;Original
1073778;Okay, here's your reward. Now, we never spoke, did we?;Original
1073779;Those Gargoyle fanatics won't be troubling anyone any time soon, eh?;Original
1073780;Tell me, do the Giant Beetles crunch when you kill them? Well, here's your pay.;Original
1073781;Ha! Blown away like smoke in the wind, those Efreets are! You earned this reward!;Original
1073782;The world is a less magical place, with dead pixies. Good job.;Original
1073783;Thinking about those eight legged monsters gives me the chills! Here, take this reward.;Original
1073784;You snapped that cold spell, eh? For facing the Ice Elementals, here's a little something.;Original
1073785;With the whipping vines thinned, farmers can get back to work.;Original
1073786;The Ant Lion infestation seems reduced. Enjoy this reward then.;Original
1073787;Reduced those Golems to component parts? Good, then -- you deserve this reward!;Original
1073788;Ha, the furry wretches' magic was no match for you! A dead ratman mage is worth something, so enjoy!;Original
1073789;The skies have been clear of drakes lately, so I guess you deserve a reward.;Original
1073790;There's hasn't been a Kraken attack lately -- congratulations!;Original
1073791;Trade is up fifteen percent since you attacked the Sand Vortexes. You've earned a share of the profit.;Original
1073792;You've cleared the stables of evil, my friend! So here are your just rewards!;Original
1073793;For your work against the lava snakes, I have a little something for you.;Original
1073794;It'll be a cold day in you-know-where when you can't kill Artic Ogre Lords, eh?;Original
1073795;I already feel the warmth returning. Accept this reward for killing Ice Fiends!;Original
1073796;Sent them back where they belong, eh? Good work.;Original
1073797;The world will not miss those blubbery brutes. For what you've done, enjoy this reward.;Original
1073798;Don't look at me that way. Just take your reward and leave.;Original
1073799;Mother will appreciate your fine work. Here, don't tell her I gave you this.;Original
1073800;The shadow of Titans no longer stretches across the land. Thanks to you!;Original
1073801;Thanks to you for stopping those orcish louts. You deserve this rich reward.;Original
1073802;You have extinguished the gargoyle threat, traveler. Thanks to you.;Original
1073803;Those pale monsters are no more. Enjoy the rewards of the just!;Original
1073804;You have performed a noble service. Here, please take this reward.;Original
1073805;Dragons mean treasure my friend -- enjoy this reward!;Original
1073806;I can only hope these undead stay in their graves once and for all.;Original
1073807;Thanks goodness someone thinks of the children. Enjoy this token of our esteem.;Original
1073808;The gargoyle menace has been thwarted. Thank you, traveler.;Original
1073809;You faced the hordes of the underworld and overcame. For that, I will be forever grateful.;Original
1073810;With any luck, those dragons won't be back again!;Original
1073811;You sent those foreign dragons packing, didn't you? My thanks!;Original
1073812;The stench of decay subsides, thanks to you.;Original
1073813;You've rid the land of an ancient evil. My best wishes, friend.;Original

1074004;You have carved a path in history, sought to understand the way from our sage companions.;Original
1074005;And now you have returned full circle to the place of your origin within the arms of Mother Sosaria. There is but one thing left to do if you truly wish to embrace your elven heritage. ;Original
1074006;To be born once more an elf, you must strip of all worldly possessions. Nothing of man or beast much touch your skin.;Original

1074064;Hurry up! I don't have all day to wait for you to bring what I desire!;Original
1074065;These human made goods are laughable! It offends so -- I must show you what elven skill is capable of!;Original
1074066;We elves are no strangers to archery but I would be interested in learning whether there is anything to learn from the human approach. I would gladly trade you something I have if you could teach me of the deadly crossbow bolt.  ;Original
1074067;I wish to try a bow crafted in the human style. Is it possible for you to bring me such a weapon? I would be happy to return this favor.;Original
1074068;I have heard of a curious type of bow, you call it a "crossbow". It sounds fascinating and I would very much like to examine one closely. Would you be able to obtain such an instrument for me?;Original
1074069;These human "crossbows" are complex and clever. The "heavy crossbow" is a remarkable instrument of war. I am interested in seeing one up close, if you could arrange for one to make its way to my hands. ;Original
1074070;My friend, I am in search of a device, a instrument of remarkable human ingenuity. It is a repeating crossbow. If you were to obtain such a device, I would gladly reveal to you some of the secrets of elven craftsmanship.;Original
1074071;Humans artistry can be a remarkable thing. For instance, I have heard of a wonderful instrument which creates the most melodious of music. A lap harp. I would be ever so grateful if I could examine one in person. ;Original
1074072;How clever humans are -- to understand the need of feet to rest from time to time!  Imagine creating a special stool just for weary toes.  I would like to examine and learn the secret of their making.  Would you bring me some foot stools to examine?;Original
1074073;Humans have remarkable desire to secure what they "possess". I would be fascinated to see how a human would choose to contain something in a wooden chest. Do you think you could bring me such an item, in exchange for knowledge of elven ways?;Original
1074074;The manner by which humans produce cloth is remarkable. A spinning wheel -- how clever! Could you arrange for me to experiement with such a device? ;Original
1074075;I understand men decorate their living spaces with furniture such as a cherry armoire. It sounds like a beautiful, if strange invention. I would appreciate an opportunity to examine the craftsmanship on such an object.;Original
1074076;Such a simple ingredient, yet so versatile! Sweet dough -- what can it not do? I would love to experiment and discover new frontier in the baking arts -- if only I had a supply of this sweet dough. ;Original
1074077;I have heard tales of a potent dish. One that is both strong, yet delicate. Rich, but light. A baked quiche. Such culinary wizardry sounds delightful and I would be very appreciative to one who could provide me with such a meal.;Original
1074078;I am told of a speciality dish, a meal of carefully prepared fish. Such a sushi platter must be sublime in its delicacy. I would be eternally grateful if you could provide me with such meal.;Original
1074079;Humans have a splendid dish I am told, one that harvests the fruits of nature and tastes like drops of the golden sun! A peach cobbler. Such a dish must be priceless, but if you could provide it for me to taste, I would happily teach you more of the elven ways.;Original
1074080;I desire to try a simple human meal. Something hearty, but simple. Perhaps, a cut of ribs? Yes, that sounds right. Perhaps, if you were to provide this for me, I could instruct you in the ways of elven cooking?;Original
1074081;My friend, perhaps you are interested in elven wine? It is a wonderous elixir but I require a supply of that most precious fruit, a bunch of grapes. Please, bring some to me.<br>;Original
1074082;I have discovered through great effort the dread after effects of human wine. My friend, I would be forever in your debt if you provide for me some of these cure potions which removes the efforts of noxious toxins. ;Original
1074083;I understand men are not unfamiliar with the winemaking arts. Does the wine of humans quench thirst like the dew off a morning lily? Perhaps I could see for myself?;Original
1074084;We elves are interested in trading our wines with humans but we understand human usually trade such brew in strange transparent bottles. If you could provide some of these empty glass bottles, I might engage in a bit of elven winemaking;Original
1074085;Oh, the deviltry! Why would humans lock their precious liquors inside a wooden coffin? I understand I need a "keg tap" to access the golden brew within such a wooden abomination. Perhaps, if you could bring me such a tap, we could share a drink and I could teach you.;Original
1074086;What wonders! A concotion that let's one see in the darkest night! How marvelous! Perhaps, you would obtain for me such night sight potions so that I might banish the darkest from my eyes. ;Original
1074087;In a perilous world, one can never be too cautious. I understand mankind has developed a potion of healing to cure terrible injuries. I am certain we elves could benefit from this knowledge, so if you bring healing potions to me, I will teach you of elven lore.;Original
1074088;These alchemy of humans is a wonderous and destructive art! I hear that an "explosive" potion produces a force of fiery potency when used. It sounds fascinating and I would like to see with my own eyes. Are you able to bring me such explosive potions?;Original
1074089;The power of a great forrest fire contained in a simple glass container? How remarkable and terrible! I must see for myself. Could you bring for me some of these greater conflagration potions? I will, naturally, reciprocate the favor.;Original
1074090;Human friend, tell me, is it true there is a dark side to the human art of alchemy? It is troubling to hear such tales -- I feel I must examine the toxins humans produce. Please, bring to me a supply of the deadliest poison humans craft. For this favor, I will grant you precious elven knowledge. ;Original
1074091;Most human apparel is…interesting to elven eyes. But there is one garment -- the flower garland -- which sounds very elven indeed. Could I see how a human crafts such an object of beauty? In exchange, I could share with you the wonders of elven garments.;Original
1074092;I have heard noble tales of a fine and proud human garment. An article of clothing fit for both man and god alike. It is called a "kilt" I believe? Could you fetch for me some of these kilts so I that I might revel in their majesty and glory?;Original
1074093;We elves believe that beauty is expressed in all things, including the garments we wear. I wish to understand more about human aesthetics, so please kind traveler -- could you bring to me magnificent examples of human fancy shirts? For my thanks, I could teach you more about the beauty of elven vestements.;Original
1074094;Forgive me for saying this, but so much of human clothing is strange to elven eyes. For instance, the fur sarong. I have difficultry believing what I hear, so I must gaze upon it with my own two eyes. Bring some to me and I will happily repay the favor.;Original
1074095;It is my understanding, the females of humankind actually wear on certain occasions a studded bustier? This is not simply a fanciful tale? Remarkable! It sounds hideously uncomfortable as well as ludicrously impracticle. But perhaps, I simply do not understand the nuances of human clothing. Perhaps, I need to see such a studded bustier for myself?;Original
1074096;What a thing, this human need to tinker. It seems there is no end to what might be produced with a set of Tinker's Tools. Who knows what an elf might build with some? Could you obtain some tinker's tools and bring them to me? In exchange, I offer you elven lore and knowledge. ;Original
1074097;Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?;Original
1074098;The wonders of human invention! Turning sand and metal into a far-seeing eye! This is something I must experience for myself. Bring me some of these spyglasses friend human;Original
1074099;Is it true human? There are those among your kind who can construct an autonomaton that mocks the shape of a man? It is a frightening but intriguing notion! I must see these golems for myself. Please, bring me a golem and I will reward you with an elven teaching. ;Original
1074100;To give voice to the passing wind, this is an idea worthy of an elf! Friend, bring me some of the amazing fancy wind chimes so that I may listen to the song of the passing breeze. Do this, and I will share with you treasured elven secrets.;Original
1074101;I am curious to see the results of human blacksmithing. To examine the care and quality of a simple item. Perhaps, a simple bascinet helmet? Yes, indeed -- if you could bring to me some bascinet helmets, I would demonstrate my gratitude. ;Original
1074102;The clank of human iron and steel is strange to elven ears. For instance, the metallic heater shield which human warriors carry into battle. It is odd to an elf, but nevertheless intriguing. Tell me friend, could you bring me such an example of human smithing skill?;Original
1074103;What would you say is a typical human instrument of war? Is a broadsword a typical example? I wish to see more of such human weapons, so I would gladly trade elven knowledge for human steel. ;Original
1074104;There is supposedly a terrible and impressive blade forged by the hand of man. The no-dachi, a sword which requires great smithy skills. I would be honored to view the work of such a mastery human smith. If you can assist me, I would be greatly honored. ;Original
1074105;Mankind, I am told, knows how to take the scales of a terrible dragon and forge them into powerful armor. Such a feat of craftsmanship! I would give anything to view such a creation -- I would even teach some of the prize secrets of the elven people. ;Original
1074106;Is there a finer metal than valorite? I hear tell of its wonders, but I confess I do not believe the half of it. I must see for myself. Kind human, bring me a supply of this valorite so that I might examine it more closely. ;Original
1074107;They say men greatly covet metal colored like the fair Sosarian sun. These golden ingot with their mystical properties are of great interest to the elven people. I would be greatly indebted to a human who brough me a supply of golden ingots. ;Original
1074108;Where does one get some of this horned leather, my friend? What are its properties? How difficult is it to work? Ah, perhaps these questions would be more easily answered if you simply brought me some of this horned leather. What do you say human?;Original
1074109;I cannot help myself human. I see these balls of yarn and I wish to bat them around as if they were prey to be hunted. Please, human, bring me more of these strange and delightful balls of joys. Bring me more yarn!;Original
1074110;Well, where are the cotton bales?;Original
1074111;I have heard of a strange breed of magic, one that draws its power from the forces of death. This is not the elven way, but I confess my curiosity to understand more. Could you gather for me a quantity of the grave dust used in this necromantic magic?;Original
1074112;What do humans know of archery? Humans can barely shoot straight. Why, your efforts are absurd. In fact, I will make a wager -- if these so called human arrows I've heard about are really as effective and innovative as human braggarts would have me believe, then I'll trade you something useful.  I might even teach you something of elven craftsmanship.;Original
1074113;Human craftsmanship! Ha! Why, take an elven bow. It will last for a lifetime, never break and always shoot an arrow straight and true. Can't say the same for a human, can you? Bring me some of these human made bows, and I will show you.;Original
1074114;Leave it to a human to try and improve upon perfection. To take a bow and turn it into a mechanical contraption like a crossbow. I wish to see more of this sort of "invention". Fetch for me a crossbow, human.;Original
1074115;How lazy is man! You cannot even be bothered to pull your own drawstring and hold an arrow ready? You must invent a device to do it for you? I cannot understand, but perhaps if I examine a heavy crossbow for myself, I will see their appeal. Go and bring me such a device and I will repay your meager favor.;Original
1074116;More is always better for a human, eh? Take these repeating crossbows. What sort of mind invents such a thing? I must look at it more closely. Bring such a contraption to me and you'll receive a token for your efforts.;Original
1074117;You think you know something of music? Laughable! Take your lap harp. Crude, indelicate instruments that make a noise not unlike the wailing of a choleric child or a dying cat. I will show you -- bring lap harps, and I will demonstrate.;Original
1074118;Human fancy knows no bounds!  It's pathetic that they are so weak that they must create a special stool upon which to rest their feet when they recline!  Humans don't have any clue how to live.  Bring me some of these foot stools to examine and I may teach you something worthwhile.;Original
1074119;You would lock away all your possessions, fearing thieves everywhere, wouldn't you human? It is folly to put things in your wooden chests, flimsy as they are. I will show you how inferior they are to elven craftsmanship.;Original
1074120;Thread should woven by delicate touch, not so elaborate machine as a spinning wheel. Still, there is something intriguing about the human approach. Bring some spinning wheels, so I might see how inferior thread is created.;Original
1074121;If an elf were to create a piece of furniture, you know it would be a thing of magnificent beauty! I will show you -- bring to me a cherry armoire, what some humans would call a "beautiful" thing. Bring this, and I will point out all the ways in which it is flawed.;Original
1074122;I have tasted human breads and I find them pathetic and lacking. Perhaps, it is the ingredients? Bring for me some of this sweet dough so that I might see how you humans go wrong. Do this and I might show you how real food is created.;Original
1074123;I wish that humans could cook something at least half-way palatable to an elf. But alas, it is all gruel. Though these baked quiches sound promising. I expect they're awful, but you never know. Perhaps, you could bring some for me to try?;Original
1074124;I daresay, a human would eat dirt and straw if it were served on a plate. Raw fish and weeds of the ocean? To eat a sushi platter -- what madness! I can scarcely believe it. You must bring for me a sample of such fare, so that I may see for myself. ;Original
1074125;I am told human-made peach cobbler is a dish worthy of an elf's palate. This, I very much doubt. In fact, I will prove it. Fetch for me some of these peach cobblers and then I will show you a truly magnificent dish!;Original
1074126;You hack the ribcage off of some beast and then eat it? And call that a meal? Absurd! I will not believe it until you bring me an example of these cuts of ribs, so I might see it for myself.;Original
1074127;Humans take perfectly wonderful grapes and reduce them to the laundry water you call wine! I will show you real elven wine. Bring to me bunches of grapes, so you might know what true craftsmen can achieve.;Original
1074128;I have sampled human vintage and it has made me deathy ill. I require a cure for such poison. Bring me some cure potions, so I might recover from what humans call "wine".;Original
1074129;Do not think it ego when I say elves are superior in all ways. For example, bring a bottle of your wine so that I might gag it down. If you compare it to wonderful elven vintage and you will understand.;Original
1074130;The only good thing I can say about human made bottles is that they are empty and may yet still be filled with elven wine. Go now, fetch a number of empty bottles so that I might save them from the fate of carrying human-made wine.;Original
1074131;I have acquired a barrel of human brewed beer. I am loathe to drink it, but how else to prove how inferior it is? I suppose I shall need a barrel tap to drink. Go, bring me a barrel tap quickly, so I might get this over with.;Original
1074132;Why do humans want to see in the dark? Lurking in shadows to spy on others, that sounds like a human to me! Well, elves can fight fire with fire. Bring me some of these night sight potions and we will even the score.;Original
1074133;Humans are so clumsy and stupid, always hurting themselves. I suppose that's why they have healing potions. Hmmm, I wonder what goes into such a concotion? Go and fetch me a sample, so I might investigate.;Original
1074134;If humans are going to have explosive potions, we elves must learn more about how they are brewed. I demand you bring some of these bottles of destruction to me right away!;Original
1074135;The mindless destruction humans cause! They really brew potions of greater conflagration! I must see for myself -- bring me some directly, and I will reward you.;Original
1074136;I knew humans were treacherous devils. Take the deadly poisons they brew! To be used against who, I wonder? Bring me deadly poison potions, so I might have proof of human's murderous ways.;Original
1074137;Humans do not deserve to wear a thing such as a flower garland. Help me prevent such things from falling into the clumsy hands of humans -- bring me flower garlands!;Original
1074138;I do not believe humans are so ridiculous as to wear something called a "kilt". Bring for me some of these kilts, if they truly exist, and I will offer you meager reward.;Original
1074139;Humans call that a fancy shirt? I would wager the ends are frayed, the collar worn, the buttons loosely stitched. Bring me fancy shirts and I will demonstrate the many ways in which they are inferior.;Original
1074140;To murder creatures of the forrest for such a ridiculous garment as a fur sarong! It boggles the mind. Perhaps, the skins of the poor animals can be made into a proper garment. Bring me fur sarongs, so I might bring some dignity to the dead creatures.;Original
1074141;No self respecting elf female would ever wear a studded bustier! I will prove it -- bring me such clothing and I will show you how ridiculous they are!;Original
1074142;Bring me some of these tinker's tools! I am certain, in the hands of an elf, they will fashion objects of ingenuity and delight that will shame all human invention! Hurry, do this quickly and I might deign to show you my skill.;Original
1074143;Elves find it remarkable the human preoccupation with the passage of time. To have built instruments to try and capture time -- it is a fascinating notion. I would like to see how a clock is put together. Maybe you could provide some clocks for my experimentation?;Original
1074144;Humans are so pathetically weak, they must be augmented by glass and metal! Imagine such a thing! I must see one of these spyglasses for myself, to understand the pathetic limits of human sight!;Original
1074145;Imagine! A mechanical thing which mocks a man! A golem, what an idea. I am curious about how humans create such a monstrous thing. Perhaps, I can learn more to use it against the devious humans. Go, get me a golem so I might see it more closely. ;Original
1074146;I understand humans cruely enslave the very wind to their selfish whims! Fancy wind chimes, what a monstrous idea! You must bring me proof of this terrible depredation -- hurry, bring me wind chimes!;Original
1074147;You want to discuss the pathetic qualities of human craftsmanship? How about their bascinet helmets -- weak and flimsy things, your head would be better protect by maple leaves or a bit of straw. I will show you -- bring me some bascinet helmets and I will show you how pathetic they are.;Original
1074148;I doubt very much a human shield would stop a good stout elven arrow. You doubt me? I will show you -- get me some of these heater shields and I will piece them with sharp elven arrows!;Original
1074149;Pathetic, this human craftsmanship! Take their broadswords -- overgrown butter knives, in reality. No, I cannot do them justice -- you must see for yourself. Bring me broadswords and I will demonstrate their feebleness. ;Original
1074150;Some humans think their no-dachis are impressive swords. I'd rather fight with an elven quill pen in hand! I will show you how clumsy and dull they are if you bring me a few, so that we might mock their inferior workmanship.;Original
1074151;Forging a great suit of armor from the scales of a dragon seems an idea worthy of an elf -- so I'm sure these humans have ruined it. Bring me a complete suit of this dragon armor, so I might see all the ways in which humans have done an inferior job of creation.;Original
1074152;Well, where are the boards?;Original
1074153;Valorite is one of the few metals that seems worthy of an elf's attention. With such a metal, I could craft something that would demonstrate the pinnacle of elven superiority! Get me some valorite ingots so I might forge such an item!;Original
1074154;Humans lust so terribly for gold. Pathetic really. They barely understand what can be done with the metal. I will demonstrate what elves can craft if you'll bring some of the golden ingots. ;Original
1074155;I require a quantity of horned leather to craft something that will inspire awe, wonder and fear among the sad humans. Hurry, fetch for me this horned leather so that I might shame human craftsmen everywhere!;Original
1074156;Here's a task even a human could do. Bring me balls of yarn. Yes, balls of yarn. Even pathetically made human yarn will do, for in the hands of an elf, wonders can be achieved. ;Original
1074157;Humans will violate the graves of their own kind? Truly? I would have thought human indencency had some boundaries, but apparently, I am wrong. Prove this is true -- bring to me some human gathered grave dust.;Original
1074158;Ah good, you're back.  We're eager for the feast.;Original
1074159;As you open the iron maiden, your surroundings mysteriously change!;Original

1074165;You feel dizzy from a lack of clear air;Original

1074172;Certainly.  There is plenty of time to explore such things.  Return to me should you decide the time is now.;Original
1074173;Ah Seeker, I had not thought to see you again in that form.  Perhaps you have difficulty finding the wise Darius?  I do not know where he wanders, but I can tell you that he is always curious, so perhaps you'll find him near a great curiousity?;Original

1074182;Did you find it?;Original
1074183;You there! I have a job for you.;Original

1074187;Want a job?;Original
1074188;Weakling! You are not up to the task I have.;Original
1074189;Hey tough guy! I have a job, but I doubt you are up too it.  It requires someone far braver then you.;Original
1074190;*sigh* Oh no. You won’t do at all.  Look at you, so weak, so puny.  Oh no no no. ;Original
1074191;Just keep walking away!  I thought so. Coward!  I’ll bite your legs off! ;Original
1074192;Ridiculous peasant!  I laugh in your general direction!  You are not up to my challenge!;Original
1074193;You there! Yes you. Stop looking about like a toadie and come here.;Original
1074194;You’re not Drithen! I should have known right away, just look at you. Oh well, you’ll have to do I guess...;Original
1074195;You there, in the stupid hat!   Come here.;Original
1074196;Excuse me! I’m sorry to interrupt but I urgently need some assistance. ;Original
1074197;Pardon me, but if you could spare some time I’d greatly appreciate it.;Original
1074198;Might you lend a troubled soul some assistance?;Original
1074199;Help! I need somebody! Won’t you please, please help me!;Original
1074200;Thank goodness you are here, there’s no time to lose.;Original
1074201;Waste not a minute! There’s work to be done. ;Original
1074202;It’s you!   I’m saved, you are just in time.;Original
1074203;Hello friend. I realize you are busy but if you would be willing to render me a service I can assure you that you will be judiciously renumerated.;Original
1074204;Greetings seeker.  I have an urgent matter for you, if you are willing. ;Original
1074205;Oh great adventurer, would you please assist a weak soul in need of aid?;Original
1074206;Excuse me please traveler, might I have a little of your time?;Original
1074207;Good day to you friend! Allow me to offer you a fabulous opportunity!  Thrills and adventure await! ;Original
1074208;I’d like to speak to an adventurer please. If I can have just a few minutes of your time, I’d like to offer you an exciting opportunity.;Original
1074209;Hey, could you help me out with something? ;Original
1074210;Hi.  Looking for something to do?;Original
1074211;I could use some help.;Original

1074218;Hey!  I want to talk to you, now.;Original
1074219;Hello there, can I have a moment of your time?;Original
1074220;May I call you friend?  I have a favor to beg of you.;Original
1074221;Greetings!  I have a small task for you good traveler. ;Original
1074222;Could I trouble you for some assistance?;Original
1074223;Have you done it yet?  Oh, I haven’t told you, have I?;Original
1074224;My ire has been appeased by your efforts.  You are deserving of this reward.;Original
1074225;A noble deed you have done this day.  This reward is nothing to a hero such as yourself.;Original

1074285;It is true that a skilled arcanist can summon and dominate an imp to serve at their pleasure.  To do such at thing though, you must master the miserable little fiends utterly by demonstrating your superiority.  Rough them up some -- kill a few.  That will do the trick.;Original
1074286;The children of Sosaria understand the dedication and committment of an arcanist -- and will, from time to time offer their friendship.  If you would forge such a bond, first seek out a goodwill offering to present.  Pixies enjoy sweets and pretty things.;Original
1074287;You're probably right.  They're not worth the effort.;Original
1074288;There's always time to make new friends.;Original
1074289;Surely you're not having difficulties swatting down those annoying pests?;Original
1074290;I think honey and some sparkly beads would please a pixie.;Original

1074316;Mean reapers are all around trees!  *giggle*  You fix them up, please.;Original
1074317;Well, hurry up.  If you don't get a whip how do you expect to control the little devil?;Original
1074318;You need to vanquish an arcane daemon before the imps will fear you properly.;Original
1074319;*giggle*  Oooh!  For me?;Original
1074320;*giggle* Mean reapers got fixed!  Pixie friend now! *giggle* When mean thingies bother you, a brave pixie will help.;Original
1074321;That's a well-made whip.  No imp will ignore the sting of that lash.;Original
1074322;You've demonstrated your strength, got a means of control, and taught the imps to fear you.  You're ready now to summon them.;Original

1074404;Perhaps you have heard of the service I offer?  Perhaps you wish to avail yourself of the opportunity I lay before you.;Original
1074405;Elves and humans; we lived together once in peace.  Mighty relics that attest to our friendship remain, of course.  Yet, memories faded when the Gem was shattered and the world torn asunder.  Alone in The Heartwood, our elven brothers and sisters wondered what terrible evil had befallen Sosaria.;Original
1074406;Violent change marked the sundering of our ties.  We are different -- elves and humans.  And yet we are much alike.  I can give an elf the chance to walk as a human upon Sosaria.  I can undertake the transformation.;Original
1074407;But you must prove yourself to me.  Humans possess a strength of character and back.  Humans are quick-witted and able to pick up a smattering of nearly any talent.  Humans are tough both mentally and physically.  And of course, humans defend their own -- sometimes with their own lives.;Original
1074408;Seek Sledge the Versatile and learn about human ingenuity and creativity.  Seek Patricus and demonstrate your integrity and strength.;Original
1074409;Seek out a human in need and prove your worth as a defender of humanity.  Seek Belulah in Nu'Jelm and heartily challenge the elements in a display of toughness to rival any human.;Original
1074410;You have proven yourself capable and commited and so I will grant you the transformation you seek.;Original
1074411;Or turn away and embrace your heritage.  It matters not to me.;Original

1074434;Oh help! Help me!  I don't want to end up like my sisters, enslaved by the cruel Melisande.  I cannot flee, I am bound here by the evil of the harpy Saliva.  Won't you please help me and redeem my sisters at the same time?  I will grant you my blessing in return.;Original
1074435;Please, I'm so frightened.  I don't want to become twisted and corrupt.  Please free me!;Original
1074436;Until my sisters have been treated with mercy and released from their twisted existence and until the vile Saliva is slain, I cannot feel safe or bestow my blessing.;Original
1074437;Oh!  You've returned.  I cannot thank you enough for saving me.  I only hope Melisande doesn't return them to life once more.  Bless you, fair adventurer. Bless you.  If you wish to face Melisande in battle, place the token of my blessing in the basket.  May you be triumphant and redeem us all through your efforts.;Original
1074438;Misplaced;Original
1074439;Shhh!  *nervous chuckle* Oh, sorry about that.  I forget that I'm not in the library any longer -- and instead that THING has taken over.  If that wasn't distressing enough, I've misplaced my thesis pages and they've been gathered up by the shambling dead.  Could you retrieve them for me?;Original
1074440;Disintegrating Thesis Notes;Original
1074441;*tense sigh* Of course, I understand.  If you change your mind, I'll be waiting.;Original
1074442;Most of the creatures here wouldn't be interested in my thesis.  *nervous chuckle*  Master Gnosos would argue that no one is -- not even the undead.  Still, I'd wager that the more powerful undead have my pages.;Original
1074443;Ah!  You've got my pages?  Oh no ... they've been damaged.  Here, take this key.  Perhaps you can find the podium and gain access to the library.  My poor books are being ravaged by that horror and you'd do well to put things right.;Original
1074444;Wonders of the Natural World;Original
1074445;Step right up!  Step right up!  Lords and Ladies, this is your opportunity to view the find of a lifetime!  What magical energy caused the fascinating play of light and darkness within these subterranean passageways?  What mysterious forces are at work deep within the Prism of Light?  Admission tickets are good for a full day of adventure and excitement and well worth the price at 10,000 gold. Whadda ya say?;Original
1074446;C'mon now Lords and Ladies -- you're passing up the opportunity of a lifetime.  Is 10,000 gold too much to pay for your enlightenment?;Original
1074447;Dig into those pockets Lords and Ladies!  Just ten-thousand-shiny-gold-coins and you'll be walking in the bootsteps of the famous Lord Denthe himself!;Original
1074448;Step right up!  Thank you, enjoy the amazing caverns.;Original
1074449;Dangerous Crossing;Original
1074450;Ho there!  If you wish to cross and test yourself in the Blighted Grove, you'll need a special machete.  Luckily I have one right here and it's for sale!  Only 1,000 gold each.;Original
1074451;Yah, you didn't like like you could handle it.  Probably just as well.;Original
1074452;What kind of adventurer are you that you can't afford to outlay some gold on good equipment.  You'll need this machete to get under those roots.  It's a good price.;Original
1074453;Best of luck!  Watch out for Lady Melisande.  She's a nasty one.;Original
1074454;Watch Your Step;Original
1074455;You won't be able to get into the sinkhole with any normal rope.  It's a big drop, sure, but the real problem is the acid and poison gas.  See, most ropes can't stand up to that kind of treatment, even for a short period of time.  So you'll need a special rope -- a magical rope. Like these ones I happen to have available here for a mere 5,000 gold each.;Original
1074456;I sure don't want to go down there either.  You won't hear me chiding you. In fact, I commend your intellect.;Original
1074457;The price isn't going to change.  It's 5,000 per rope please.;Original
1074458;Be careful down there. I don't like losing customers.;Original
1074459;That's okay, I'll find someone else to make the delivery.;Original
1074460;If I knew where my cousin was, I'd make the delivery myself.;Original
1074461;Oh, hello there.  What do you have for me?;Original
1074462;The best thing about my job is that I do a little bit of everything, every day.  It's what we're good at really.  Just picking up something and making it do something else.  Listen, I'm really low on parts.  Are you interested in fetching me some supplies?;Original

1074519;Ho there!  There's nothing quite like a day's honest labor to make you appreciate being alive.  Hey, maybe you'd like to help out with this project?  These crates need to be delivered to Sledge.  The only thing is -- it's a bit of a rush job and if you don't make it in time, he won't take them.  Can I trust you to help out?;Original
1074520;Crate for Sledge;Original
1074521;Oh yah, if you're too busy, no problem.;Original
1074522;Sledge can be found in Buc's Den.  Better hurry, he won't take those crates if you take too long with them.;Original
1074523;Hey, if you have cargo for me, you can start unloading over here.;Original
1074524;Oh!  I just don't know what to do.  My mother is away and my father told me not to talk to strangers ... *worried frown*  But my grandfather has sent word that he has been hurt and needs me to tend his wounds.  He has a small farm southeast of here.  Would you ... could you ... escort me there safely?;Original
1074525;I hope my grandfather will be alright.;Original
1074526;Grandfather's farm is a ways west of the Shrine of Spirituality. So, we're not quite there yet.  Thank you again for keeping me safe.;Original
1074527;It's all about hardship, suffering, struggle and pain.  Without challenges, you've got nothing to test yourself against -- and that's what life is all about.  Self improvement!  Honing your body and mind!  Overcoming obstacles ... You'll see what I mean if you take on my challenge.;Original
1074528;My way of life isn't for everyone, that's true enough.;Original

1074534;The Ancient World;Original
1074535;The lore of my people mentions Mondain many times.  In one tale, it is revealed that he created and enslaved a race -- a sort of man bull, known as a 'minotaur'.  The tales speak of mighty warriors who charged with blood-soaked horns into the heat of battle.  But, alas, the fate of the bull-men is unknown after the rupture.  Will you seek information about their civilization?;Original
1074536;Warriors of the Gemkeeper;Original
1074537;Here we honor the Gemkeeper's Apprentice and seek to aid her efforts against the humans responsible for the death of her teacher -- and the destruction of the elven way of life.  Our tales speak of a fierce race of servants of the Gemkeeper, the men-bulls whose battle-skill was renowned.  It is desireable to discover the fate of these noble creatures after the Rupture.  Will you seek information?;Original
1074538;I am disappointed, but I respect your decision.;Original
1074539;A traveler has told me that worshippers of Mondain still exist and wander the land.  Perhaps their lore speaks of whether the bull-men survived.  I do not think they share their secrets gladly.  You may need to be 'persuasive'.;Original
1074540;I care not how you get the information.  Kill as many humans as you must ... but find the fate of the minotaurs.  Perhaps another of the Gemkeeper's servants has the knowledge we seek.;Original
1074541;You have discovered an important clue!;Original
1074542;What have you found?;Original
1074543;The Golden Horn;Original
1074544;Close Enough;Original
1074545;Ah ha!  You see here ... and over here ... The map fragment places the city of the bull-men, Labyrinth, on that piece of Sosaria that was thrown into the sky.  Hmmm, I would have you go there and find any artifacts that remain that help tell the story.  But, legend speaks of a mighty barrier to prevent invasion of the city.  Take this map to Braen and explain the problem. Perhaps he can devise a solution.;Original
1074546;Ah ha!  You see here ... and over here ... The map fragment places the city of the bull-men, Labyrinth, on that piece of Sosaria that was thrown into the sky.  Hmmm, I would have you go there and seek out these warriors to see if they might join our cause.  But, legend speaks of a mighty barrier to prevent invasion of the city.  Take this map to Canir and explain the problem. Perhaps she can devise a solution.<br>;Original
1074547;Braen is nearby, run and speak with him.;Original

1074551;Taking the Bull by the Horns;Original
1074552;Oh, I see. I will need some materials to infuse you with the essence of a bull-man, so you can fool their defenses.  The most similar beast to the original Baratarian bull that the minotaur were bred from is undoubtedly the mighty Gaman, native to the Lands of the Feudal Lords.  I need horns, in great quantity to undertake this magic.;Original
1074553;Interesting.  I believe I have a way.  I will need some materials to infuse you with the essence of a bull-man, so you can fool their defenses.  The most similar beast to the original Baratarian bull that the minotaur were bred from is undoubtedly the mighty Gaman, native to the Lands of the Feudal Lords.  I need horns, in great quantity to undertake this magic.;Original
1074554;Oh come now, don't be afraid.  The magic won't harm you.;Original
1074555;I cannot grant you the ability to pass through the bull-men's defenses without the gaman horns.;Original
1074556;You've returned at last!  Give me just a moment to examine what you've brought and I can perform the magic that will allow you enter the Labyrinth.;Original

1074574;What do you want?  Wonderful, another whining request for a refund on tuition.  You know, experiences like that are invaluable ... and infrequent.  Having the opportunity to test yourself under such realistic situations isn't something the college offers all students.  Fine. Fine.  You'll need to submit a refund request form in triplicate before I can return your 1,000,000 gold tuition.  You'll need to get some signatures and a few other odds and ends.;Original

1074581;Well hello there. Oh.  Wait a minute, you're not here to plead the case of that traitor Danoel are you?;Original
1074582;Ah!  You found my property.  Thank you for your honesty in returning it to me.;Original
1074583;Isn't that interesting?  Someone was willing to pay a lot of gold to see me gone.  You've earned a reward for bringing this to me.;Original
1074584;You have discovered a private letter from the sorceress Minax to her dear friend "Travesty" that implicates some very important people in her pay.  Will you risk drawing attention to yourself by delivering the bundle to the castle in Britain?<br>;Original
1074585;Probably a wise choice to keep a low profile.;Original
1074586;It might be safest to deliver the letter to someone trustworthy that isn't too important.  Sarakki the Notary might be a good choice.;Original

1074609;Heh.  Heheheh.  Good one.  You're not a Bedlam student and you're definitely not eligible for a tuition refund.  Heheheh. That old witch Aernya doesn't see as well as she used to you know.  Otherwise, she would have ... hmmm, wait a minute.  I sense a certain 'opportunity' here.  I'll sign your forms in return for a little help with a project of my own.  What do you say?;Original

1074617;Oh excellent, you're back.  I'll get the oven going.  That thing about pixie legs, you see, is that they burn and dry out if you're not really careful.  Taste just like chicken too!;Original
1074618;Fooling Aernya;Original
1074619;Now that I've signed your papers you'd better get back to that witch Aernya.  Mmmm mmm smell those ribs!;Original
1074620;Giving up on your scheme eh?  Suit yourself.;Original
1074621;You better hurry back to Mistress Aernya with that signed form.  The college only has so much money and with enough claims you may find yourself unable to get your tuition refunded.  *wink*;Original
1074622;What?  Hrmph.  Gorrow signed your form did he?  Let me see that.  *squint*;Original
1074623;Not Quite That Easy;Original
1074624;I wouldn't be too smug just yet, whiner.  You still need Master Gnosos' signature before I can cut your refund.  Last I heard, he's coordinating the recovery of the portions of the college that are currently overrun.  *nasty smile*  Off with you.;Original

1074629;Convince Me;Original
1074630;I'm not signing any forms until the situation here is under control.  So, you can either help out or you can forget getting your tuition refund.  Which will it be?  Help control the shambling dead?;Original
1074631;No signature for you.;Original
1074632;No signature for you until you kill off some of the shambling dead out there and destroy that blasted horse.;Original
1074633;Pulled it off huh?  Well then you've earned this signature!;Original
1074634;Tuition Reimbursement;Original
1074635;Well, there you are.  I've added my signature to that of Gorrow, so you should be set to return to Mistress Aernya and get your tuition refunded.;Original
1074636;Great! If you're going to stick around here, I know we have more tasks for you to perform.;Original
1074637;Just head out the main gates there and you'll find yourself embracing the iron maiden in the Bloodletter's Guild.;Original
1074638;*disinterested stare*  What?  Oh, you've gotten your form filled in.  How nice.  *glare*  And I'd hoped you'd drop this charade before I was forced to rub your nose in it.  *nasty smile*  You're not even a student and as such, you're not eligible for a refund -- you've never paid tuition.  For your services, Master Gnosos has recommended you receive pay.  So here.  Now go away.;Original

1074645;Dreadhorn;Original
1074646;Can you comprehend it? I cannot, I confess.  The most pristine and perfect Lord of Sosaria has fallen prey to the blight.  From the depths of my heart I mourn his corruption; my thoughts are filled with pity for this glorious creature now tainted.  And my blood boils with fury at those responsible for the innocent creature's undoing.  Will you find Dread Horn, as he is now called, and free him from this misery?;Original
1074647;How can you not feel as I do?;Original
1074648;The lush and fertile land where Dread Horn now lives is twisted and tainted, a result of his corruption.  The fey folk have sealed the land off through their magics, but you can enter through an enchanted mushroom fairy circle.;Original
1074649;Thank you.  I haven't the words to express my gratitude.;Original
1074650;You have discovered a blood-stained journal that details the adventures of Lord Denthe.  The pages make for fascinating reading, telling the tale of the great man's efforts to uncover the secrets of the Prism of Light.  Will you donate the journal to a library so others may hear the tale of Lord Denthe's final expedition?;Original
1074651;Or, you could keep the journal for your private library.;Original
1074652;The librarian in Britain would be glad of your donation of Lord Denthe's journal.;Original
1074653;Shhhh!  What have YOU done to that book?  It's covered in ... is that blood?  *furious glare*  Let me see that.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  Do you realize how important this journal is?  Here, take this for your trouble.;Original
1074654;The most incredible tale has reached my ears!  Deep within the bowels of Sosaria, somewhere under the city of Nu'Jelm, a twisted creature feeds.  What created this abomination, no one knows ... though there is some speculation that the fumbling initial efforts to open the portal to The Heartwood, brought it into existence.  Regardless of it's origin, it must be destroyed before it damages Sosaria.  Will you undertake this quest? ;Original
1074655;Perhaps I thought too highly of you.;Original
1074656;An explorer discovered the cave system under Nu'Jelm.  He made multiple trips into the place bringing back fascinating crystals and artifacts that suggested the hollow place in Sosaria was inhabited by other creatures at some point.  You'll need to follow in his footsteps to find this abomination and destroy it.;Original
1074657;I am overjoyed with your efforts!  Your devotion to Sosaria is noted and appreciated.;Original
1074658;Oh, the trauma!  *weeps loudly*  My lucky dagger has been lost.  It was given to me by my father, as a final gift before he died.  That blade has been an heirloom of my family for generations.  I must have it back.  *sniffles pathetically*  Please, find my lucky dagger.;Original
1074659;*wailing cries* Then begone if you will not help a poor man in need.;Original
1074660;*sniffles*  The dagger was stolen by some dishonest man.  Or perhaps I dropped it.  That doesn't matter though.  All that matters is that you find my dagger and return it.;Original
1074661;You've found it?  My lucky dagger!;Original
1074662;You look strong and brave, my friend.  Are you strong and brave?  I only ask because I am known to be too generous to those that find for me interesting -- things -- to use in my smithing.  What do you say?;Original
1074663;*nods*;Original
1074664;I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those essences.;Original
1074665;I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those crystalline fragments.;Original
1074666;I can't be generous, my friend, until you bring me those icy hearts.;Original
1074667;My friend, you've returned -- with items for me, I hope?  I have a generous reward for you.;Original
1074668;Good, you're here.  The presence of a twisted creature deep under the earth near Nu'Jelm has corrupted the natural growth of crystals in that region.  They've become infused with the twisting energy -- they've come to a sort of life.  This is an abomination that festers within Sosaria.  You must eradicate the crystal daemons.;Original

I'm working on building my troglodyte display and I'm saddened to say that I'm short on examples of religion and superstition amongst the creatures.  If you come across any primitive fetishes, I'd be happy to trade you something interesting for them.;Original
1074678;I don't really want to know where you get the primitive fetishes, as I can't support the destruction of their lifestyle and culture. That would be wrong.;Original
1074679;Bravo!  These fetishes are just what I needed.  You've earned this reward.;Original
1074680;I don't know if you can handle it, but I'll give you a go at it.  Troglodyte chief -- name of Lurg and his mangy wolf pet need killing.  Do the deed and I'll reward you.;Original
1074681;A Trog and His Dog;Original
1074682;The trog chief and his mutt should be easy enough to find.  Just kill them and report back.  Easy enough.;Original
1074683;Not half bad.  Here's your prize.;Original
1074684;New Cloak;Original
1074685;I have created a masterpiece!  And all I need to finish it off is the soft fur of a wolf.  But not just ANY wolf -- oh no, no, that wouldn't do.  I've heard tales of a mighty beast, Grobu, who is bonded to the leader of the troglodytes.  Only Grobu's fur will do.  Will you retrieve it for me? ;Original
1074686;I've told you all I know of the creature.  Until you return with Grobu's fur I can't finish my cloak.;Original
1074687;Ah! So soft, so supple.  What a wonderful texture.  Here you are ... my thanks.;Original
1074688;Troglodytes!;Original
1074689;Oh nevermind, you don't look capable of my task afterall.  Haha!  What was I thinking -- you could never handle killing troglodytes.  It'd be suicide.  What?  I don't know, I don't want to be responsible ... well okay if you're really sure?;Original
1074690;Probably the wiser course of action.;Original
1074691;You still need to kill those troglodytes, remember?;Original

I am working to develop a natural means to prevent these corrupted seedlings from taking root, but without samples of such seeds, I'm forced to guess wildly what might work.  Will you harvest some tainted bogling seeds for me?;Original
1074710;I'm working on a striking necklace -- something really unique -- and I know just what I need to finish it up.  A huge fang!  Won't that catch the eye?  I would like to employ you to find me such an item, perhaps a snake would make the ideal donor.  I'll make it worth your while, of course.;Original
1074711;Scale Armor;Original
1074712;Here's what I need ... there are some creatures called hydra, fearsome beasts, whose scales are especially suitable for a new sort of armor that I'm developing.  I need a few such pieces and then some supple alligator skin for the backing.  I'm going to need a really large piece that's shaped just right ... the tail I think would do nicely.  I appreciate your help.;Original
1074713;The Medallion;Original
1074714;You have discovered an insciption on the back of the medallion that reads 'love always, your Belulah'.  Since the wearer of the necklace has met a grisly end, perhaps you'd be willing to track down Belulah?;Original
1074715;You are already protected with this slimy ointment.;Original
1074716;You are no longer under the protection of the slimy ointment.;Original
1074717;Certain tamed animals are accepted as donations by transfering the pet to the collection box.;Original
1074718;Tainted seeds please.  Look for the bigggest, meanest bogling you can find.;Original
1074719;<CENTER>Food Decoration Tool</CENTER>;Original
1074720;This is perfect!;Original
1074721;Do you have it?  *gasp* What a tooth!  Here … I must get right to work.;Original
1074722;Those really big snakes like swamps, I've heard.  You might try the blighted grove.;Original
1074723;I understand.  I don't like snakes much either.  They're so creepy.;Original
1074724;Hydras have been spotted in the Blighted Grove.  You won't get those scales without getting your feet wet, I'm afraid.;Original
1074725;I can't wait to get to work now that you've returned with my scales.;Original
1074726;A Tale of Tail;Original
1074727;I've heard of you, adventurer.  Your reputation is impressive, and now I'll put it to the test. This is not something I ask lightly, for this task is fraught with danger, but it is vital.  Seek out the vile hydra Abscess, slay it, and return to me with it's tail.;Original
1074728;Well, the beast will still be there when you are ready I suppose.;Original
1074729;Em, I thought I had explained already.  Abscess, the hydra, you know? Lots of heads but just the one tail.  I need the tail. I have my reasons. Go go go.;Original
1074730;Ah, the tail.  You did it!  You know the rumours about dried ground hydra tail powder are all true?  Thank you so much!;Original
1074731;Or you could keep the medallion instead.;Original
1074732;The name 'Belulah' is the only clue you find on the medallion.;Original
1074733;Greets!  How can I … oh.  Oh no!  Is that … my darling Thorvald!  *quiet weeping*  Thank you for your kindness in returning this to me.  It means … a lot.  *sniffle*;Original
1074734;The hero returns from the glorious battle and - oh, such a small feather?;Original
1074735;If you're going to get anywhere in the adventuring game, you have to take some risks.  A harpy, well, it's bad, but it's not a dragon.;Original
1074736;The path to greatness isn't for everyone obviously.;Original
1074737;I've seen how you strut about, as if you were something special. I have some news for you, you don't impress me at all. It's not enough to have a fancy hat you know.  That may impress people in the big city, but not here. If you want a reputation you have to climb a mountain, slay some great beast, and then write about it.  Trust me, it's a long process.  The first step is doing a great feat.  If I were you, I'd go pluck a feather from the harpy Saliva, that would give you a good start.;Original
1074738;A Feather in Yer Cap;Original
1074739;Guile, Irk and Spite;Original
1074740;You know them, don't you.  The three?  They look like you, you'll see. They looked like me, I remember, they looked like, well, you'll see.  The three.  They'll drive you mad too, if you let them.  They are trouble, and they need to be slain.  Seek them out.;Original
1074741;Drool;Original
1074742;When I was a child I was savaged by a Cu'Sidhe.  It ran up and slobbered all over me. Long story short:  it was horrible, I was traumatized and I've never been the same since.  Look at me now.  Kill them, kill them all.  Well at least a few.;Original
1074743;I don't think I'm asking anything unreasonable here.;Original
1074744;Slaughter me some  -- Cu'Sidhe.  I'm a poet!;Original
1074745;You just don't understand the gravity of the situation.  If you did, you'd agree to my task.;Original
1074746;Perhaps I was unclear.  You'll know them when you see them, because you'll see you, and you, and you.  Hurry now.;Original
1074747;Are you one of THEM?  Ahhhh!  Oh, wait, if you were them, then you'd be me.  So you're -- you.  Good job!;Original
1074748;It's rare to find someone who shares my aversions and is willing to take immediate measures.  I'm glad we met.;Original
1074749;Ha ha!  This just goes to prove that there's no request that someone is not willing to fuffilll.  Well done my friend!;Original
1074750;Momento!;Original
1074751;I was going to march right out there and get it myself, but no ... Master Gnosos won't let me.  But you see, that bridle means so much to me.  A momento of happier, less-dead ... well undead horseback riding.  Could you fetch it for me?  I think my horse, formerly known as 'Resolve', may still be wearing it.;Original
1074752;Hrmph.;Original
1074753;The bridle would be hard to miss on him now ... since he's skeletal.  Please do what you need to do to retreive it for me.;Original
1074754;I'd know that jingling sound anywhere!  You have recovered my bridle.  Thank you.;Original
1074755;Culinary Crisis;Original
1074756;You have NO idea how impossible this is.  Simply intolerable!  How can one expect an artiste' like me to create masterpieces of culinary delight without the best, fresh ingredients?  Ever since this whositwhatsit started this uproar, my thrice-daily produce deliveries have ended.  I can't survive another hour without produce!;Original
1074757;You have no artistry in your soul.;Original
1074758;I must have fresh produce and cheese at once!;Original
1074759;Those dates look bruised!  Oh no, and you fetched a soft cheese.  *deep pained sigh*  Well, even I can only do so much with inferior ingredients.  BAM!;Original

1074954;Eureka!;Original
1074955;Sub Contracting;Original
1074956;Heya!  I'm sure glad to see you.  Listen I'm in a bit of a bind here.  I'm supposed to be gathering poisoned water at the base of that corrupted tree there, but I can't get in under the roots to get a good sample.  The branches and brush are so tainted that they can't be cut, burned or even magically passed.  It's put my work at a real standstill.  If you help me out, I'll help you get in there too.  Whadda ya say?;Original
1074957;This is some nasty stuff, that's for certain.  I don't even want to think about what sort of blight caused this venomous reaction from that old tree.  Let's get to work … we'll need to try something really hard but still workable as our base material.  Nothing's harder than stone and diamond.  Let's try them first.;Original
1074958;Hmm, I've never even heard of something that can damage diamond like that.  I guess we'll have to go with plan B.  Let's try something similar.  Sometimes there's a natural immunity to be found when you use a substance that's like the one you're trying to cut.  A sort of "sympathetic" thing.  Y'know?;Original
1074959;Amazing!  The bark was reduced to ash in seconds.  Whatever this taint is, it plays havok with living things.  And of course, it took the edge off both diamonds and granite even faster.  What we need is something workable but dead; something that can hold an edge without melting.  See what you can come up with, please.;Original
1074960;We're in business!  I've put together the instructions for chopping sort of sword, in the style of one of those new-fangled elven machetes.  Take those back to Jamal for me, if you would.;Original
1074961;Wonderful!  Now we can both get in there!  Let me show you these instructions for making this machete.  If you're not skilled in smithing, I'm not sure how much sense it will make though.  Listen, if you're heading in there anyway … maybe you'd do me one more favor?  I'm ah ... buried in work out here ... so if you'd go in and get me a few water samples, I'd be obliged.;Original
1074962;A step closer to entering Blighted Grove.;Original
1074963;(10) workable samples;Original
1074964;Okay.  If you change your mind, I'll probably still be stuck here trying to get in.;Original
1074965;Sure, no problem.  I thought you were interested in figuring this out.;Original
1074966;Well, okay.  I guess I thought you'd want to see this through.;Original
1074967;Oh.  Right, I guess you're really ... ah ... busy too.;Original
1074968;My friend, Iosep, is a weaponsmith in Jhelom.  If anyone can help us, he can!;Original
1074969;If you're a miner, you should have no trouble getting that stuff.  If not, you can probably buy some samples from a miner?;Original
1074970;I think a lumberjack can help supply bark.;Original
1074971;I'm thinking we need something fairly brittle or it won't hold an edge.  And, it can't be alive, of course.;Original

1075072;<h2>Yew</h2><br>The City of Justice<br>Yew is a small, peaceful town nestled amongst the trees in the great forest of northwestern Britannia. Its people live at peace with the land, raising crops, tending flocks, and gathering wild plants for use in healing and magic. Because of its quiet, pastoral nature, Yew attracts many rangers in addition to the druids who founded it.<br>The druids are known for their ability to see things truly and without bias, and are responsible for having constructed the mighty Empath Abbey, which is found in the northern portion of the city. This place is a center for learning and self-reflection that draws travelers from the world over.<br>Because of their eternal quest to find justice and equality, the druids have also been given the responsibility for administering justice. The great courtroom on the far western edge of the city's boundaries has often been the site of momentous trials, and the prison beyond has been the home for many dangerous criminals.<br>In the heart of Yew, a magical portal has been opened that allows access to the great elven home, The Heartwood. The druids of Yew and the elves of the Heartwood have been exchanging good will through ambassadors, though there have been claims of hostile factions on both sides.<br> For those interested more in adventure than in history or peace, the wilderness around Yew is wild, indeed. A small number of shops provide the needs for adventurers with the skills to brave the wilds, but little is offered in the way of further training, as no guilds make their homes here.<br>Amenities: Baker, Bank, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Tanner;Original
1075073;<h2>Minoc</h2><br>The Miners' Frontier <br><br> The city of Minoc has boomed in recent years, due to the rich veins of ore that can be found in the nearby mountains. Situated along the northern coast of Britannia, the city is a haven for the tinkers, miners, and blacksmiths who depend upon these abundant resources for their livelihood. Those who wish to begin a career in any of these arts, as well as prospectors who are willing to brave the danger-filled forests nearby, will find this town an excellent home. <br>Minoc is also interesting in its large population of gypsies and old-timers who have been mining since the town was a small hamlet. Because it is fairly distant from the rule of Lord British and has grown up quickly from very small beginnings to significant wealth, Minoc is a rough frontier town. Although guards keep the peace in the city streets, the surrounding countryside can be dangerous indeed. Travelers should beware of bandits, thieves, and prowling monsters.<br>Mount Kendall is one of Britannia's most famous mountains, known for its caves and rich ore veins.<br> For those seeking to learn a trade, Minoc offers guild halls for miners and warriors.<br><br> Amenities: Architect, Armorer, Bank, Blacksmith, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Provisioner, Stable, Tanner, Tavern, Tinker. ;Original
1075074;<h2>Britain</h2><br>The City of Bards<br><br> The thriving city of Britain is the capital city of Britannia and home to the famed Lord British, ruler of the realm. An excellent home base for any professional starting out his career, Britain offers numerous opportunities for training, purchasing equipment, learning new skills, and experiencing the world's many social opportunities. Within the city, you will find examples of the best and worst that Britannia has to offer. Outside, every road presents an opportunity for danger and excitement, with roads leading to every part of Britain's mainland. For would-be adventurers, guild halls in the area offer training for prospective bards, miners, and warriors.<br><br> The most famous of Britain's many city landmarks is Lord British's enormous castle, found on the western side of the city. Also of interest are the many fine centers of learning and the arts, such as Lord British's Conservatory of Music, located just beyond his castle walls. Bards from all over Britannia come here to study their craft and to entertain one another through music.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Bank, Baker, Blacksmith, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Mage shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Stables, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Veterinarian;Original
1075075;<h2>Moonglow</h2><br>The City of Magic<br><br> The mages' town of Moonglow has long been devoted to the study of things magical. Although there are enough amenities to suit any adventurer, much of this small island is devoted to magical commerce and entertainment. Those who wish to improve their skills as a mage or purchase magical implements often make their homes here.<br><br> For those scholars who are happy to reside here indefinitely, Moonglow offers several guilds for training in the magical arts, as well as a wide variety of shops devoted to spells, reagents, potions, and other magical gear. <br> Because Moonglow is on an island, it does not offer many opportunities for combat, but a nearby moongate offers access to the mainland for would-be adventurers who seek a wider world in which to adventure.<br><br> Newcomers to the town should be sure to visit the network of teleporters which reach all corners of the island, as well as the fine zoo in its southern portion and the telescope perched on its eastern edge. <br><br> Amenities: Alchemist, Armorer, Baker, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Herbalist, Provisioner, Reagent Shop, Tailor, Weapons, Woodworker ;Original
1075076;<h2>Trinsic</h2><br><br> The Walled City Trinsic, home of Britain's paladins, is known far and wide for its warriors, its code of honor, and its dedication to preserving and protecting the realm of Britannia. Any skill or item of equipment necessary for practicing the warrior's trade can be found in abundance within the city's towering city walls, including a number of guilds and meeting halls devoted to the art of combat.<br><br> Trinsic also offers a branch of the tinkers' guild for those of a more inventive nature and a fishermen's guild for those who wish to plumb the sea of its many treasures. <br><br> Due to its location on the dangerous southern end of the continent, Trinsic has frequent disputes with pirates, giants, ogres, and trolls that roam the surrounding coastline and countryside. Those who venture forth from Trinsic's gate and into the southern tip of the continent must be bold, indeed. <br><br> Within the city, visitors will find a fine natural garden, a number of attractive bridges spanning the river that splits the city, and excellent training halls and stables. The marketplace in the southeastern corner of the city is also worth visiting.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Baker, Bank, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Provisioner, Stable, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Weapons<br>;Original
1075077;<h2>Magincia</h2><br>Isle of Riches<br><br> Magincia is a fairly small island town known for the incredible wealth that it derives from the sea and from the practice of the magical arts. The city itself is beautiful to behold, with golden streets and majestic architecture. Honest tradesmen do not linger for long upon this isle, however, preferring to pass through the moongate upon its western edge in search of a more pleasing environment.<br><br> For those who seek to begin a career in Magincia, however, the city does offer guilds for fishermen and miners, and  a modest collection of shops. Little in the way of danger ever finds its way here, but the moongate does offer abundant danger on its other side.<br><br> For the visitor, Magincia's most impressive sites are its Parliament Building and the Temple to the Virtues - even if these are rarely practiced in the city.<br><br> Should an adventurer join the ranks of Magincia's elite and purchase a ship, the docks to the south of the city offer access to the many other islands nearby.<br><br> Amenities: Baker, Bank, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Magic Shop, Shipwright, Tailor, Tavern, Tinker;Original
1075078;<h2>Jhelom</h2><br>Mercenaries' Isle<br><br> Jhelom is a city run by warriors for warriors. Home of the famed Dueling Pit, the city offers the realm's best warriors a chance to test their skills in combat against one another in non-lethal combat. <br><br> Because of its large populace of warriors, Jhelom is a very rough-and-tumble city, but tightly enforced laws keep disorder to a minimum, and the pit allows disputes to be settled under carefully controlled circumstances.<br><br> Jhelom's military government has a general dislike for mages and things magical, so all magical shops are restricted to the tiny southernmost island of the chain, although shops occasionally offer magical weapons and armament for those who desire them. <br><br> Most of the commerce in the area, however, is dedicated to the trappings of physical combat and to training adventurers in its practice. Guilds for both warriors and armorers are to be found on the main island.<br><br>  As an island city, Jhelom is not particularly dangerous for starting adventurers, but a moongate on the central island offers daring adventurers a chance to enter the wilderness in search of danger and reward. Often, merchants and other travelers camp by the gate awaiting escort to Britain's other cities.<br><br> Amenities: Armorer, Baker, Bank, Blacksmith, Butcher, Counselors' Guild, Fish Shop, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Mage Shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Tailor, Tavern, Tinker, Weapons, Woodworker<br>;Original
1075079;<h2>Skara Brae</h2><br>The City of Rangers<br><br> Skara Brae is a peaceful, clean city dedicated to the spirituality and the arts. The rangers and other folk who dwell therein are attuned to nature and the natural state, and they are very much at home in the forests of Britannia - so much so that their city extends from its main island into the forests on the west coast of Britannia proper.<br><br> The city itself is home to a guild of rangers and all manner of shops that one would visit before undertaking a long journey. Equipment for riding, traveling on shipboard, and walking is available, and supplies for self-preservation in times of danger abound.<br><br> Because the inhabitants of Skara Brae are more inclined to intellectualism than other warriors, they embrace both magical and physical combat, and both are well represented here.<br><br> For those seeking adventure in the wilds, a gate from the main island leads to the extension of the town along the coast of Britannia, and from there it is a short trip into the forests and swamps of the southern mainland where monsters and more mundane creatures abound.<br><br> Amenities: Animal Supplies, Armorer, Bank, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Counselors' Guild, Healer, Inn, Magic Shop, Provisioner, Reagent Shop, Shipwright, Stable, Tailor, Tavern, Weapons Shop;Original
1075080;<h2>Vesper</h2><br>The City of Bridges<br><br> Vesper is a center for trade in Britannia, both overland from Minoc and Cove, and overseas from the major islands. Because of the continual influx of wealth, it is a city of playfulness and decadence where magic and the arts are in continued evidence. Beneath the surface, deception and corruption lurk,  however, and guards are common through the bridges and streets of the city.<br><br> Almost anything can be bought and sold in Vesper, and the numerous shops and places of learning sit on dozens of small islands in a river delta connected everywhere by beautiful bridges. As a center for trade, the city has attracted craftsmen and adventurers of every kind, and guilds for mages, miners, warriors, and fishermen can be found here.<br><br> For those inclined to dally, the museum of Vesper is an interesting side-trip for visitors to the city.<br><br> Adventure-seekers can find plenty of danger to the northeast, where dark forests hold dangerous monsters. The road north to Minoc and the long west road to Britain or Yew also offer danger, as thieves often lurk along these pathways in search of unwary travelers.<br><br> Amenities: Alchemist, Armorer, Bank, Baker, Beekeeper, Blacksmith, Bowyer, Butcher, Carpenter, Fish Shop, Healer, Inn, Jeweler, Magic shop, Provisioner, Shipwright, Tailor, Tanner, Tavern, Tinker  ;Original

1075312;I was born and raised in Buc’s Den. Have you been there? Then you know what a lawless place it is. Five years ago, my mother and father were killed by brigands there. I was only a child, and so I was sent here to live with my uncle.<br>Recently, a man moved into town, and I’m sure this man is the one who killed my parents. The sheriff will do nothing, he doesn’t believe me. What can I do? I’m no warrior. I can’t use magic. I don’t have the courage to avenge my family. Please, if you have any love at all for justice, I beg of you, seek out and slay this criminal!;Original
1075313;Amulet of Righteousness;Original
1075314;Why? This man has killed many innocent people. Would you let him walk around, free?;Original
1075315;This brigand, Gregorio, you can find him in the farmland to the east of town. He usually wears a red skull cap and carries a pitchfork. ;Original
1075316;He is dead, then? Good! I can think of no one more deserving. Thank you for your help. I feel that a great weight has been lifted from me. Here, I would like you to take this necklace. It belonged to my mother. She said it has some magic, but I have never been able to discover how it works. Perhaps you can.;Original

1075322;My father died in an accident some months ago. My mother refused to accept his death. We had a little money set by, and she took it to a necromancer, who promised to restore my father to life. Well, he revived my father, all right, the cheat! Now my father is a walking corpse, a travesty . . . a monster. My mother is beside herself -- she won't eat, she can't sleep. I prayed at the shrine of Spirituality for guidance, and I must have fallen asleep. When I awoke, there was this basin of clear water. I cannot leave my mother, for I fear what she might do to herself. Could you take this to the graveyard, and give it to what is left of my father?;Original
1075323;Aurelia's gratitude.;Original
1075324;Oh! Alright then. I hope someone comes along soon who can help me, or I don’t know what will become of us.;Original
1075325;My father - or what remains of him - can be found in the graveyard northwest of the city.;Original
1075326;What is this you give me? A basin of water?;Original

1075328;You tell me it is time to leave this flesh. I did not understand until now. I thought: I can see my wife and my daughter, I can speak. Is this not life? But now, as I regard my reflection, I see what I have become. This only a mockery of life. Thank you for having the courage to show me the truth. For the love I bear my wife and daughter, I know now that I must pass beyond the veil. Will you return this basin to Aurelia? She will know by this that I am at rest.;Original

1075338;My father, Andros, is a smith in Minoc. Last week his forge overturned and he was splashed by molten steel. He was horribly burned, and we feared he would die. An alchemist in Vesper promised to make a bandage that could heal him, but he needed the silk of a dread spider. I came here to get some, but I was careless, and succumbed to their poison. Please, won’t you help my father?;Original
1075339;Hurry! You must get the silk to Leon the Alchemist quickly, or it will crumble and become useless!;Original
1075340;Oh . . . that’s your decision . . . OooOoooOOoo . . . ;Original
1075341;Thank you! Deliver it to Leon the Alchemist in Vesper. The silk crumbles easily, and much time has already passed since I died. Please! Hurry!;Original
1075342;How may I help thee? You have the silk of a dread spider? Of course I can make you a bandage, but what happened to Frederic?;Original
1075343;A Father’s Gratitude;Original
1075344;That is simply terrible. First Andros, and now his son. Well, let’s make sure Frederic’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain. Will you take the bandages to his father? You can probably deliver them faster than I can, can’t you?;Original
1075345;Andros’ Gratitude;Original
1075346;Well I’m sorry to hear you say that. Without your help, I don’t know if I can get these to Andros quickly enough to help him.;Original
1075347;I don’t know how much longer Andros will survive. You’d better get this to him as quick as you can. Every second counts!;Original
1075348;Sorry, I’m not accepting commissions at the moment. What? You have the bandage I need from Leon? Thank you so much! But why didn’t my son bring this to me himself? . . . Oh, no! You can't be serious! *sag* My Freddie, my son! Thank you for carrying out his last wish. Here -- I made this for my son, to give to him when he became a journeyman. I want you to have it.;Original

They used to mine it in Malas, but alas, those veins ran dry some time ago. I hear it may have been found in the Prism of Light. Oh, if only there were a bold adventurer within earshot who would go to the Prism of Light and retrieve some for me!;Original

1075359;You can find Prismatic Amber in the Prism of Light, located just north of the city of Nujel'm.;Original
1075360;I knew it! See, it’s just the color I needed! Look how it brings out the highlights of her wheaten tresses!;Original
1075361;Gentle Blade;Original
1075362;I came to this place looking for a cure for my wife. But I’m getting ahead of myself -- my wife was attacked by a werewolf, and survived. Now she has become a werewolf herself. My research has turned up nothing that would cure her affliction. *Sob* She begged me to end her suffering, but I cannot. She has removed herself to a remote part of Ice Island so that she does not endanger others. If I give you the means, will you go there, find her, and give her the mercy of a clean death? ;Original
1075363;Misericord;Original
1075364;I understand. I am no warrior, either. I suppose I shall have to wait here until one comes along.;Original
1075365;My wife is hiding out in a cave on the north end of Ice Island. You will not be able to harm here, even with the weapon I gave you, until night falls and she transforms into a wolf.;Original
1075366;Thank you my friend . . . I know she is at peace, now. Here, keep the weapon. Most of its power is expended, but it remains somewhat potent against wolf-kind.;Original
1075367;Unfading Memories;Original
1075368;Finished! With the pigment I was able to create from the Prismatic Amber you brought me, I was able to complete my humble work. I should explain. Once, I loved a noble lady of gentleness and refinement, who possessed such beauty that I have found myself unable to love another to this day. But it was from afar that I admired her, for it is not for one so lowly as I to pay court to the likes of her. You have heard of the fair Thalia, Lady of Nujel'm? No? Well, she was my Muse, my inspiration, and when I heard she was to be married, I lost whatever pitiful talent I possessed. I felt I must compose a portrait of her, my masterpiece, or I would never be able to paint again. You, my friend, have helped me complete my work. Now I ask another favor of you. Will you take it to her as a wedding gift? She will probably reject it, but I must make the offer.;Original
1075369;The Artist’s gratitude.;Original
1075370;Alright then, you have already helped me more than I deserved. I shall find someone else to undertake this task.;Original
1075371;The wedding is taking place in the palace in Nujel'm. You will likely find her there.;Original
1075372;I’m sorry, I’m getting ready to be married. I don’t have time to . . . what’s that you say?;Original
1075373;Unfading Memories;Original
1075374;Emilio painted this? It is absolutely wonderful! I used to love looking at his paintings, but I don’t remember him creating anything like this before. Would you be so kind as to carry a letter to him? Fate may have it that I am to marry another, yet I am compelled to reveal to him that his love was not entirely unrequited.;Original
1075375;Bleach;Original
1075376;Very well, then. If you will excuse me, I need to get ready.;Original
1075377;Take the letter back to the Artist’s Guild in Britain, if you would do me this kindness.;Original
1075378;She said what? She thinks what of me? I . . . I can’t believe it! All this time, I never knew how she truly felt. Thank you, my friend. I believe now I will be able to paint once again. Here, take this bleach. I was going to use it to destroy all of my works. Perhaps you can find a better use for it now.;Original

1075382;Ah. I see. Never mind then.;Original

1075393;Beg pardon, sir. I mean, madam. Uh, can I ask a favor of you? I found this jeweled ring.  Most people would sell it and keep the money, but not me. I ain't never stole nothing, and I ain't about to start. I tried to take it over to Brit castle, figgerin' it must belong to some highborn lady, but the guards threw me out. You look like they might let you pass. Will you take the ring over there and see if you can find the owner?;Original
1075394;Find the ring’s owner.;Original
1075395;I see. Too good to help an honest beggar like me, eh?;Original
1075396;A jewel like this must be worth a lot, so it must belong to some noble or another. I would show it around the castle. Someone’s bound to recognize it.;Original
1075397;Didst thou find my ring? I thank thee very much! It is an old ring, and a gift from my husband. I was most distraught when I realized it was missing.;Original
1075398;Regina’s Thanks;Original
1075399;What’s that you say? It was a humble beggar that found my ring? Such honesty must be rewarded. Here, take this packet and return it to him, and I will be in your debt.;Original
1075400;Transparent Heart;Original
1075401;Hmph. Very well. What did you say his name was?;Original
1075402;Take the packet and return it to the beggar who found my ring.;Original
1075403;What? For me? Let me see . . . these sapphire earrings are for you, it says. Oh, she wants to offer me a job! This is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me! ;Original
1075404;Doughty Warriors;Original
1075405;You did great work. Thanks to you, my puppies are training harder than ever. I think they could actually take a mongbat now. I’m still worried they’ll slack off, though. What say you to slaying some Imps for me now? Show them how it’s really done?;Original
1075406;Show them what a real warrior is REALLY made of!;Original
1075407;You’re pretty sad. When I was a young warrior, I wasn’t one to walk away from a challenge.;Original
1075408;You won’t find many imps on this continent. Mostly, they’re native to Ilshenar. Might be a few up around the hedge maze east of Skara Brae, though.;Original
1075409;Hah! I knew you were up to the challenge.;Original
1075410;Doughty Warriors;Original
1075411;You’ve really inspired my trainees. They’re working harder than ever. I’ve got one more request for you, and it’s a big one. Those mongbats didn’t pose a problem. You mowed down the imps with no trouble. But do you dare take on a couple of daemons?;Original
1075412;Sash of Might;Original
1075413;What? You’re not scared of a couple of lousy daemons, are you?;Original
1075414;There’s all kinds of daemons you can kill. There are some near the hedge maze, and some really powerful ones in Dungeon Doom.;Original
1075415;Thanks for helping me out. You’re a real hero to my guards. Valor is its own reward, but maybe you wouldn’t mind wearing this sash. We don’t give these out to just anyone, you know!;Original
1075416;The Honor of the De Boors;Original
1075417;I beg your pardon, but will you listen to my story? My family, the de Boors family, have been jewel traders as far back as anyone can remember. Alas, by the time I was born, we had fallen on hard times. <br>To survive, I have had to sell much of my family’s property. Most of it was meaningless, but I regret that a few years ago I made a terrible mistake. I pawned a shield bearing my family’s coat of arms to a loan shark. That shield was borne into battle by Jaan de Boors, the founder of our house! It has no value to anyone, but that blackguard won’t believe I have no money. He wants a fortune in jewels before he will return it.<br>Now I have learned that I am dying. Soon I will be gone, and my lineage with me. For the sake of what little honor is left to me and my family name, I cannot bear to leave our ancestral shield in the hands of that villain. Will you help me recover it?<br>;Original
1075418;Gather them quickly. Who knows how long Derek has to live?;Original
1075419;I know how much I am asking. Please, can you not help a dying man restore his family’s honor?;Original
1075420;Are you sure? You are very kind. Many of the monsters around here, when slain, are found to have jewels in their stomachs. From innocents they have eaten, no doubt.;Original
1075421;You have done it! Bless you! I do appreciate this very much! Though, will you do me one last favor?;Original
1075422;Jack the Villain;Original
1075423;Will you take the jewels to the loan shark? I am not well enough to go myself, though it is not far.;Original

1075425;Ah well. You have already helped me by gathering the jewels. I cannot complain.;Original
1075426;The name of the villain is Jack, you will find him over by the port.;Original
1075427;What do you want? Oh, that jewel merchant wants his shield back, eh?;Original

1075479;You there! Do you know much about the ways of cooking? If you help me out, I'll show you a thing or two about how it's done. Bring me some cookie mix, about 5 batches will do it, and I will reward you. Although, I don't think you can buy it, you can make some in a snap! First get a rolling pin or frying pan or even a flour sifter. Then you mix one pinch of flour with some water and you've got some dough! Take that dough and add one dollop of honey and you've got sweet dough. add one more drop of honey and you've got cookie mix. See? Nothing to it! Now get to work!;Original
1075480;Argh, I absolutely must have more of these 'cookies!' Come back if you change your mind.;Original
1075481;Thank you! I haven't been this excited about food in months!;Original
1075482;Truth be told, the only way to get a feel for the bow is to shoot one and there's no better practice target than a sheep. If ye can shoot ten of them I think ye will have proven yer abilities. Just grab a bow and make sure to take enough ammunition. Bows tend to use arrows and crossbows use bolts. Ye can buy 'em or have someone craft 'em. How about it then? Come back here when ye are done.;Original
1075483;Fair enough, the bow isn't for everyone. Good day then.;Original
1075484;Return once ye have killed ten sheep with a bow and not a moment before.;Original

If you can make me a few Refresh potions, I will be back on my feet and can give those lizards the what for! Find a mortar and pestle, a good amount of black pearl, and ten empty bottles to store the finished potions in. Just use the mortar and pestle and the rest will surely come to you. When you return, the favor will be repaid.;Original
1075489;Fine fine, off with *cough* thee then! The next time you see a lizardman though, give him a whallop for me, eh?;Original
1075490;Just remember you need to use your mortar and pestle while you have empty bottles and some black pearl. Refresh potions are what I need.;Original

1075507;*sighs* I think bowcrafting is a might beyond my talents. Say there, you look a bit more confident with tools. Can I persuade thee to make a few arrows? You could have my satchel in return... 'tis useless to me! You'll need a fletching kit to start, some feathers, and a few arrow shafts. Just use the fletching kit while you have the other things, and I'm sure you'll figure out the rest.;Original

1075529;Have a pickaxe? My supplier is late and I need some iron ore so I can complete a bulk order for another merchant. If you can get me some soon I'll pay you double what it's worth on the market. Just find a cave or mountainside and try to use your pickaxe there, maybe you'll strike a good vein! 5 large pieces should do it.;Original
1075530;More Ore Please;Original
1075531;Not feeling strong enough today? Its alright, I didn't need a bucket of rocks anyway.;Original
1075532;Hmmm… we need some more Ore. Try finding a mountain or cave, and give it a whack.;Original
1075533;I see you found a good vien! Great!  This will help get this order out on time. Good work!;Original
1075534;'Tis a riddle, you see! "What kind of clock is only right twice per day? A broken one!" *laughs heartily* Ah, yes *wipes eye*, that's one of my favorites! Ah... to business. Could you fashion me some clock parts? I wish my own clocks to be right all the day long! You'll need some tinker's tools and some iron ingots, I think, but from there it should be just a matter of working the metal.;Original

I could trade you one of my old leather bound books for some.;Original

1075713;Ah... no, that is not quite right. Truly, Humility is something that takes time and experience to understand. I wish to challenge thee to seek out more knowledge concerning this virtue, and tomorrow let us speak again about what thou hast learned.<br>;Original
1075714;Very good! I can see that ye hath more than just a passing interest in our work. There are many trials before thee, but I have every hope that ye shall have the diligence and fortitude to carry on to the very end. Before we begin, please prepare thyself by thinking about the virtue of Humility. Ponder not only its symbols, but also its meanings. Once ye believe that thou art ready, speak with me again.;Original
1075715;I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.;Original
1075716;Community Service - Museum;Original
1075717;'Tis time to help out the community of Britannia. Visit the Vesper Museum and donate to their collection, and eventually thou wilt be able to receive a replica of the Shepherd's Crook of Humility. Once ye have it, return to me. Art thou willing to do this?;Original
1075718;Very well, ye hath much work to do.;Original
1075719;I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.;Original
1075720;Hello my friend. The museum sitteth in southern Vesper. If ye go downstairs, ye will discover a small donation chest. That is the place where ye should leave thy donation.;Original
1075721;Terrific! The Museum is a worthy cause. Many will benefit from the inspiration and learning that thine donation hath supported.;Original
1075722;Community Service – Zoo;Original
1075723;Now, go on and donate to the Moonglow Zoo. Givest thou enough to receive a 'For the Life of Britannia' sash. Once ye have it, return it to me. Wilt thou continue?;Original
1075724;Good, thine path awaits;Original
1075725;I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.;Original
1075726;Hello again. The zoo lies a short ways south of Moonglow. Close to the entrance thou wilt discover a small donation chest. That is where thou shouldest leave thy donation.;Original
1075727;Wonderful! The Zoo is a very special place from which people young and old canst benefit. Thanks to thee, it can continue to thrive.;Original
1075728;Community Service – Library;Original
1075729;I have one more charity for thee, my diligent friend. Go forth and donate to the Britain Library and do that which is necessary to receive a special printing of ‘Virtue’, by Lord British. Once in hand, bring the book back with ye. Art thou ready?;Original
1075730;Impressive, thou art determined.;Original
1075731;I wish that thou wouldest reconsider.;Original
1075732;Art thou having trouble? The Library lieth north of Castle British's gates. I believe the representatives in charge of the donations are easy enough to find. They await thy visit, amongst the many tomes of knowledge.;Original

1075734;Who's Most Humble;Original
1075735;Thou art challenged to find seven citizens spread out among the towns of Britannia: Skara Brae, Minoc, Britain, and one of the towns upon an isle at sea.

1075738;There art no less than seven 'humble citizens' spread across the Britannia proper. I know that they can be found in the towns of Minoc, Skara Brae and Britain. Another may be upon an island at sea, the name of which escapes me at the moment. Thou needeth visit all seven to solve the puzzle.

1075740;Hello friend. Yes, I work with yon horses each day. I carry bails of hay, feed, and even shovel manure for those beautiful beasts of burden. Everyone who rideth my animals enjoy their temperament and health. Yet, I do not ask for any recognition.;Original
1075741;All I need is but a simple ~1_desire~.;Original
1075742;If I ever receive that which I need, I wilt gladly trade it for this ~1_gift~.;Original
1075743;Ah, thank you! This ~1_desire~ is just what I needed. Please taketh this ~2_gift~ - I hope it will be of use to thee.;Original
1075744;The cloak thou wearest looks warm.;Original
1075745;Good tidings to thee. I live on scraps in the shadow of Lord British's Castle. I am so close to nothing, that surely, thou canst not help but see I live a humble life.;Original
1075746;One ~1_desire~ wilt make my life so much nicer.;Original
1075747;I have no need for this ~1_gift~. For the right item, I would trade it.;Original
1075748;*gasp* A ~1_desire~, 'tis perfect. I doth have plans for this. Here, I have no need for this ~2_gift~ now.;Original
1075749;I doth have a similar cloak.;Original
1075750;Greetings. I tend my flock and provide guidance to my fellow citizens. I seek not a life full of profit. For to strive for personal recognition or social position is not a worthy cause. A humble man is happy with his place.;Original
1075751;All that I needest is a ~1_desire~.;Original
1075752;I useth this ~1_gift~ not at all. If ye bringeth me the right item, I would make a trade.;Original
1075753;Ah, ‘tis a perfect ~1_desire~. Please take this ~2_gift~ in trade.;Original
1075754;You, in the grey cloak, art thou hungry?;Original
1075755;I feedeth any who come here with the means to pay.  Be they noblemen or commoners, peaceful or aggressive, artist or barbarian, tis not my place to judge. I believeth there is value in everyone, and thus serve all.;Original
1075756;All that I wilt ask for, is a ~1_desire~.;Original
1075757;This ~1_gift~ was given to me and I cannot use it. I wilt happily trade it for the right item.;Original
1075758;Thanks to thee! This ~1_desire~ is just right. Here, this ~2_gift~ is for thee.;Original
1075759;Art thou hiding under that cloak?;Original
1075760;Greetings, friend. Didst thou know I work all day, preparing and storing all sorts of meat? My cleaver is not dainty or at all particular, but if ye bringeth something to me then I will render it useful for food. Every creature can be thought of as useful in life... or in death. Death comes to us all, my friend. I hath learned that, for certain, in this humble profession.;Original
1075761;Speaking of useful, if ye findeth me a nice ~1_desire~, I wilt be grateful.;Original
1075762;I received this ~1_gift~ as a gift. I hath no need for it, but wert ye to bring me something interesting, I would trade it, perhaps.;Original
1075763;Thou broughtest me a ~1_desire~! That will do nicely. Here, take this ~2_gift~ as thanks.;Original
1075764;Thou looketh like a fellow healer in that cloak.;Original
1075765;I am the sort of person who wandereth the countryside for weeks, my friend. All that time I spend healing good people who art in need of my services. All of this done without any reward, save the knowledge that I leadeth a life of virtue.;Original
1075766;I have my needs, however.  A ~1_desire~ would certainly help me.;Original
1075767;This ~1_gift~ was sent to me by mistake, I wouldest like to trade it for what I need.;Original
1075768;A ~1_desire~! Many thanks to thee. Please accept this ~2_gift~.;Original
1075769;That grey cloak is very nice.;Original
1075770;Greetings to thee, friend! Art thou on some sort of quest? Ye have that look about ye, and that cloak looks somewhat familiar. Ah, no matter. A break from my blacksmithing work is always welcome! I canst only talk for a little while though, there are a few things I promised to have done for the township today. After all, a community is much like a long chain, and we can only be as stronger as our weakest link!;Original
1075771;I do have a humble desire or two, though. I seem to have trouble finding a ~1_desire~.;Original
1075772;Wonderul!  A ~1_desire~!  Surely thou hast gone through much trouble to bring this for me. Please take this iron chain that I made for Gareth. ‘Tis something we once talked of for some time, and he had suggested a new method of metalworking that I have only just accomplished.;Original
1075773;Aha! Yes, this is exactly what I was looking for. What think ye of Sean? Of all those I have met, he is the least concerned with others' opinions of him. He excels at his craft, yet always believes he has something left to learn. *looks at the iron chain necklace* And it shows, does it not?;Original

1075783;*smiles* Surely thy deeds will be recognized by those who see thee wearing this shield! It shall serve as a reminder of the exalted path that thou hast journeyed upon, and I wish to thank thee on behalf of all whom thine efforts shall benefit. Ah, let us not forget that old cloak I gavest thee - I shall take it back now and give thee thine reward.;Original
1075784;*smiles* I understandeth thy feelings, friend. Ye shall remain anonymous then, to all those who shall benefit from thine efforts.<BR><br>Yet, through all these trials, perhaps thou hast come a little closer to understanding the true nature of Humility.<br>Thine efforts might seem small compared to the great world in which we live, but as more of our people work together, stronger shall our people be.<BR><BR><br>I wish for ye to keep the cloak I gave thee earlier. Thou canst do with it what thou will, but I hope that it shall serve as a reminder of the days ye spent engaged in our simple cause.<br>And although I have nothing more for thee, I wouldest exhort ye to continue upon this path, always seeking opportunities to humble thyself to the demands of the world.<br>There is a small island to the south upon which lies the Shrine of Humility. Seek solace there, and perhaps the answers to thine questions will become clear.;Original

1076416;Oh, but please be careful therein, the castle staff oft forget to clean it methinks;Original
1076417;Many of the land's finest artists come here to paint portraits;Original
1076418;Be veryyy careful in there! Nystul used to make things explode all the time! Clainin is no better!;Original
1076419;I asked Clainin what happened to him... but no one seemeth to have a good answer for me;Original
1076420;He's nice, but I miss the funny old man!;Original
1076421;'Tis so big! I used to sit in 'pon many a meeting between Lord British and his Council;Original
1076422;Aye, there is a council of Lords and Ladies that manage the kingdom in my lord's... absence;Original
1076423;The Commander gave me a fluffy pillow!;Original
1076424;Oh! Would you like to know about the castle? I can tell you about its history or even the layout!;Original
1076425;This isn't the first castle, of course! 'Tis built upon the remains of older castles as the kingdom grew;Original
1076426;Oh yes! The foundations are buried right beneath us! I once explored some of the passages;Original
1076427;Yes, quite a few are intertwined with the castle's sewer, but people are too big to fit!;Original
1076428;'Tis separate from the city's, yet almost as complex!;Original
1076429;Well, wouldst thou like to know more about the grounds or the inside?;Original
1076430;I think the most interesting things are the garden, stables, barracks, blacksmithy, training area, or that odd tower;Original
1076431;'Tis behind the castle's southwest wing. There was a time when it bustled with activity!;Original
1076432;One of Britannia's finest smithys, I canst not count how many of our guards wear the Order shields forged there;Original
1076433;Oh, there's the throne room, dining hall, kitchen, meeting hall, studio, laboratory, library, and my lord's bedroom;Original
1076434;My liege, the sovereign ruler of Britannia, yet he hath gone...;Original
1076435;I know not where, but I shall wait for him!;Original
1076436;Now the Council rules in his stead;Original
1076437;Oh, well, 'tis been a hard time for Britannia, yet the Council seemeth able to stay the course;Original
1076438;Lord British has been Britannia's ruler since its inception;Original
1076439;Our proud country's borders extend across the waves! E'en be it Trammel or Felucca, many call it home;Original
1076440;This land was brought about by Lord British and Nystul, to stay a horrible evil brought upon us by Minax;Original
1076441;Our homeland, from which many fled as Minax's armies laid waste to the kingdom...;Original
1076442;I hope she rots.;Original
1076443;May his name be cursed for ever and ever, 'tis his fault that so many troubles were wrought upon my lord;Original
1076444;With the shards of the Gem and... oh, I do carry on don't I?;Original
1076445;I canst not even comprehend that strange and horrible being;Original
1076446;After all, who shall read me stories?;Original
1076447;Yes! My lord read me many a story from a strange and wonderful land called... 'Urth?' I think 'twas.;Original
1076448;My favorite is about 'Hubert the Lion';Original
1076449;Wouldst thou like to hear the story?;Original
1076450;Lord British once drew a map of it, I wonder what happened to it? It had many countries;Original
1076451;That's a silly way to pronounce it!;Original
1076452;He told me he wast named after his birth place, how odd!;Original
1076453;The world which we know was once Sosaria, but now is one kingdom;Original
1076454;Aye! Rule, Britannia!;Original
1076455;After the Stranger defeated Mondain, my lord bound together the shattered remnants of our world into one kingdom;Original
1076456;I often wonder what happened to him... so I wrote a book when I found out!;Original
1076457;Hast thou read, 'My Story?' It recordeth many a strange thing about our world;Original
1076458;Oh yes, there were once many kingdoms in Sosaria, Lord British himself united several in his early days;Original
1076459;Akalabeth and the Lands of the Lost King became the Lands of Lord British, and the capital of Akalabeth became Britain;Original
1076460;Lord British was given the title 'Champion of the White Light,' and drove Mondain from these lands for a great time;Original
1076461;Truth, Love and Courage - from which flow all the Eight Virtues;Original
1076462;Ver!;Original

1076467;Aye, 'tis represented in this very castle!;Original

1076480;Hehe, I write books, eat cheese, and talk to people;Original
1076481;I love cheese! Dost thou have any?;Original
1076482;Some people think 'tis an odd thing, but I'm even trying to learn new languages!;Original
1076483;Aye! One day I wish to be able to talk to every intelligent race in the world;Original
1076484;Oh, for some time I hath been traveling, seeking answers;Original
1076485;I canst not tell thee more, for I am sworn to secrecy;Original
1076486;Aye! I am a mouse!;Original
1076487;... I'm sorry to see what happened to him;Original

1076496;Ne'er have I seen such a grim game as the one played that eve. For every move there was found a counter!;Original
1076497;A pawn for a pawn, a knight for a knight, and then the field was left with naught but lonely kings.;Original
1076498;And alone, neither could overturn the other...;Original
1076499;The very air was torn asunder, as though the air had been peeled away. Beyond it lay darkness and stars;Original
1076500;T'were not unlike the night sky, yet deeper and more ethereal;Original
1076501;I never wish to feel such a thing again!;Original
1076502;The Time Lord's voice penetrated me to the core. Didst he know I was there, that I and Blackthorn both witnessed this?;Original
1076503;I know something of the nature of worlds, yet in what kind of place canst one such as the Time Lord dwell?;Original
1076504;Lord British told me of it, how such an artifact of evil could be created I darest not imagine.;Original
1076505;Thou knowest then, that our world is but a shadow of another Britannia.;Original
1076506;Perhaps it is the wrong word? Yet we are not the true Britannia, and for this my lord is gone...;Original
1076507;I... understand the price that would have been paid. Yet they tell me my lord found another way;Original
1076508;Long after Blackthorn's death, though. Oh how such a horrible fate could be visited on such a noble man!;Original
1076509;All life that was unique to our world, gone! Erased as though it had never existed?;Original
1076510;I pray the protections that shield our own shard remain strong;Original
1076511;No ill fate awaits our world now should the people embrace the virtues. Yet, they do not!;Original
1076512;He seemeth to be an entity from beyond our own dimension, tasked with watching the multiverse;Original
1076513;Our world is not alone, for there are thousands upon thousands reflections of the original Britannia;Original
1076514;After the Gem was shattered, each shard kept a likeness of the world within it. Such was its power!;Original
1076515;Yes, yet, save that night in Lord British's chambers, I hath not seen him. Perhaps he is somehow limited?;Original
1076516;Nystul once spoke of a barrier surrounding our shard, as though it blocked outside interferences;Original
1076517;Perhaps the barrier canst be breached?;Original
1076518;Oh! Excuse me, I must be going;Original
1076519;Sorry! I have to be going;Original

1076798;*hic*;Original
1076799;‘Cause the court ordered me.;Original
1076800;A fate, I believe, that will be bound by Justice. Thank you.;Original
1076801;A friend of the defendant?;Original
1076802;A game played by politicians and liars (as though the two could be separate!);Original
1076803;A man who fled to safety, never warning those left behind of the horrors following after him.;Original
1076804;A man who's arrogance, who's unmitigated gall, who's foolhardy quest for glory and riches so infuriated the Ophidians that they poured war down upon us.;Original
1076805;A thousand things contributed to this war - the Scion’s Zenith was just one of them.;Original
1076806;A trial by fire burns the beast!;Original
1076807;Ah, *hic*, ah, yes Your Honor, I am present.;Original
1076808;Ah, and could you tell me a little about Papua? Before the invasion, I mean.;Original
1076809;Ah, hiccups, Your Honor, just a tad nervous.;Original
1076810;Ah, well, then. Carry on.;Original
1076811;Ah.;Original
1076812;Aha! Did you hear that everyone!?;Original

1076817;All those having anything to do before the Honorable Verina, Justice of the Court of Truth, draw near and attend.;Original
1076818;Always a pleasure.;Original
1076819;An army that would soon overwhelm Papua’s pitiful defenses, and march on towards our heartland.;Original
1076820;And because that many other like Cases of Treason may happen in Time to come, which a Man cannot think nor declare at this present Time;;Original
1076821;And finally, ask thyself,  “If it were I in Ricardo’s place, how wouldst I wish to be treated?”;Original
1076822;And how have you defined this instance of High Treason?;Original
1076823;And we appreciate it. My lord, has the Royal Council considered the charges of treason against Ricardo?;Original
1076824;And ye were up in some tree looking down, is that right?;Original
1076825;And yes, my friends, this was well beyond the Kingdom’s borders.;Original
1076826;And you just sat there?;Original
1076827;Are you familiar with the Scion’s Zenith?;Original
1076828;Art thou prepared to open?;Original
1076829;As is the Court. Didst thou have any further witnesses?;Original

1076834;Aye, that’s them.;Original

1076840;Be seated.;Original
1076841;Beauregard of Trinsic, for the Defense.;Original
1076842;Because they’re afraid you’ll discover the truth. And the truth is this:;Original
1076843;Both of my representatives have proven useless to me. Both were provided by the government, which also tries me.;Original
1076844;Britannia lays claim to all of the Lost Lands.;Original
1076845;Britannia versus Ricardo.;Original
1076846;But I cannot.;Original
1076847;But one thing I can tell you is the Truth.;Original
1076848;But they were too fast. And then the big ‘uns, the ones with the blood-stained bardiches…;Original
1076849;But wait, I’m not… I’m f…;Original
1076850;But we cannot show mercy.;Original
1076851;By the authority vested in the Royal Council, ruling pro-tempore, and by the Treason Act.;Original
1076852;By what authority do you judge this crime High Treason?;Original
1076853;Can you truly say all that Ricardo has wrought is ill?;Original
1076854;Can you truly say that Ricardo has done nothing good for the Kingdom?;Original
1076855;Casca of Heartwood as the Plaintiff, representing the government of Britannia.;Original
1076856;Claim? Do our laws extend to the Ophidians?;Original
1076857;Come! Stop! Go!;Original
1076858;Conspiracy, in the attempted assault upon a Kingdom prisoner transport unit.;Original
1076859;Could the clerk please read the summary of findings?;Original
1076860;Could the clerk please read the various conditions for which High Treason is defined?;Original
1076861;Could you define the meaning?;Original
1076862;Could you tell me about what happened when the Ophidian army invaded your town?;Original
1076863;Court dismissed.;Original
1076864;Court shall recess for one Britannian hour.;Original
1076865;Court will recess for twenty Britannian minutes!;Original
1076866;Court will reconvene in one Britannian hour.;Original
1076867;Decide his fate! Don’t be late! Kekeke.;Original
1076868;Did I murder a Brood Queen at the behest of some noble in Britain? No.;Original
1076869;Did I send wave after wave of invading marauders into the Ophidians lair seeking treasure? No.;Original
1076870;Did we not turn over a replicated copy, which they readily accepted, convinced of its realness?;Original
1076871;Did we see the Ophidians withdraw after that peaceful move?;Original
1076872;Did you listen carefully? That’s right. They, the Royal Council, are allowed to define Treason however they wish.;Original
1076873;Did you see anything while you were up there?;Original
1076874;Do you know where he got it?;Original
1076875;Does the Defense wish to accede?;Original
1076876;Dost thou wish to explain?;Original
1076877;Er, did Ricardo tell you where he obtained the crown?;Original
1076878;Er, well, yes Your Honor.;Original
1076879;Er, yes, Your Honor.;Original
1076880;Even after the so-called crime has been committed, as they have done to me.;Original
1076881;Excuse me?;Original
1076882;Finally, I would like to call Luiz the Guard to the stand, who will testify concerning the assault on Ricardo’s transport earlier this month.;Original
1076883;For the ramifications could be dire.;Original
1076884;Forgive me, my friends, for this graphic rendition.;Original
1076885;Forgive me, Your Honor.;Original
1076886;Four, Kill any member of the Royal Court; or the Sovereign’s Justices; or the Royal Council while in the pursuit of their duties;Original
1076887;Fourth, that the theft of the Scion’s Zenith was an instigating factor in the sudden uprising of the Ophidians.;Original
1076888;Friends, Britannians, Countrymen!;Original
1076889;Get this fool woman out of here!;Original
1076890;Good afternoon, Your Honor.;Original
1076891;Good afternoon, Your Honor. Might I say Her Ladyship looketh well today?;Original
1076892;Good afternoon. The clerk shall announce counsel.;Original
1076893;Guards!;Original
1076894;Guilty.;Original
1076895;Has Ricardo’s crime met these conditions?;Original
1076896;Have you ever met this man, Ricardo?;Original
1076897;Have you reached a verdict on the charge?;Original
1076898;He committed a crime, and, through his negligence, compounded the crime in an incalculable way.;Original
1076899;Heard it came from the snake people.;Original
1076900;Hehehehe.;Original
1076901;Her father was an innkeeper, and as such, she often had the opportunity to greet travelers and serve as a hostess for their visitors.;Original
1076902;Here… alone, in shock, drenched in tears and sweat and blood, the poor girl hid.;Original
1076903;Hey, Nick.;Original
1076904;High Treason, for inciting the Ophidian War.;Original
1076905;His actions have resulted in the deaths of thousands, and extraordinary loss to the Kingdom.;Original
1076906;Hmm… Save for the serious nature of the charges I might have already ordered this case retried.;Original
1076907;How are we to know it was not all a lie? A mere excuse?;Original
1076908;How can I have stolen something, when the Ophidians do not recognize our own laws?;Original
1076909;How could I, by myself, have incited a war when the "crime" I committed was so minor?;Original
1076910;How do you find the defendant?;Original
1076911;How so?;Original
1076912;How, ye may ask, might a man, a thief, in fact, be innocent?;Original
1076913;Hudson, are you from the town of Papua?;Original
1076914;I agree, Your Honor and…;Original
1076915;I am a necessary sacrifice. I am the scapegoat: the man who suffers their sins.;Original
1076916;I am Francesco, Treasurer of the Royal Council. I am here representing their will today.;Original
1076917;I am handing a copy of the Treason Act to the clerk at this time.;Original
1076918;I cannot tell you. I doubt they will ever tell you.;Original
1076919;I did, in fact, take the Scion’s Zenith from the Ophidians. Please notice I did not say “stole.”;Original
1076920;I did.;Original
1076921;I do not understand the cunning ways of law, nor the subtleties of court.;Original
1076922;I do, Your Honor.;Original
1076923;I feel this would be an appropriate time to take a short break.;Original
1076924;I got caught fencing some jewels. My testimony is part of the plea bargain.;Original
1076925;I have always respected the great Britannian legal system. I have placed my trust in it.;Original
1076926;I have received it.;Original
1076927;I mean, please ask thyself that question, and consider this case most carefully.;Original
1076928;I only wish to convey the horror this child must have endured in the darkness, while the screams of the dying echoed all around her.;Original
1076929;I plead for my life, but, oh my friends, I plead more for Justice.;Original
1076930;I remind the court that testimony given as part of a plea bargain is perfectly admissible.;Original
1076931;I see. Still, we must arrange the representation of the defendant, or reconvene when Mr. Beauregard is in a position to fulfill his capacities.;Original
1076932;I see. Who gave you that crown?;Original
1076933;I take stolen stuff and pass it on, or sell it to others.;Original
1076934;I thought she’d hid good, was sure of it, hoped so at least. But then I saw one of them snakes sniffing around the door.;Original
1076935;I want to tell you that she remained hidden and safe in that cellar.;Original
1076936;I want to tell you that the Ophidians withdrew and returned to their lairs, content with their mayhem.;Original
1076937;I would like to put forward a motion of no confidence in my Defense, Your Honor.;Original
1076938;I yield the witness to my friend, Mr. Beauregard.;Original
1076939;I’m done with this man.;Original
1076940;I’m sorry?;Original
1076941;If a man slay a beast, even outside the Kingdom’s borders, can he not take whatever he finds?;Original
1076942;If it pleases the court, my defender seems to be drunk, as well.;Original
1076943;Indeed, Your Honor, quite prepared!;Original
1076944;Indeed, Your Honor.;Original
1076945;Indeed.;Original
1076946;Indeed. So the Ophidians had no opposition?;Original
1076947;Innocent.;Original
1076948;Instead they left their nation defenseless, and now, in their haste to cover their cowardice, they lay the blame on me.;Original
1076949;Instead, the terrified child sought shelter in the depths of a dark cellar, hidden, as best she could, in the impossibly tight space between a few water barrels.;Original
1076950;Inu the Crone, kidnapped off the streets of Britain, held against her will, this man saved her!;Original
1076951;Inu… the what? Who?;Original
1076952;Irregular, but I can allow it.;Original
1076953;Is that all, Mr. Beauregard?;Original
1076954;Is that at issue? I did not…;Original
1076955;Is the Defense prepared?;Original
1076956;It cannot be argued that Ricardo stole the Scion’s Zenith, as we have written testimony that he has admitted it.;Original
1076957;it is accorded, That if any other Case, supposed Treason, which is not above specified, doth happen before any Justices,;Original
1076958;It is my hope you will answer Justice this day with a resounding voice.;Original
1076959;It was fast, that’s what it was.;Original
1076960;It went in. It was in there for a long time, and then I heard a scream. It’d gotten pretty quiet by then.;Original
1076961;Lacking any further witnesses, I call Mr. Casca to the stand.;Original
1076962;Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, I’d like to begin by telling you a story about a young girl named Liane.;Original
1076963;Ladies and gentlemen, I am not a smart man, and definitely not a noble one.;Original
1076964;Let the record show that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.;Original
1076965;Liane suffered that instant of agony alone, as she watched her father fall before her eyes, yet in all the carnage managed to escape meeting her family’s fate.;Original
1076966;Liane was no exception.;Original
1076967;Like I said, he told me he got it from the snakes.;Original
1076968;Lord Francesco was kind to point out that strange and curious addition to the Treason Act.;Original
1076969;Lord Francesco, could you introduce yourself briefly?;Original
1076970;Lord Francesco, please.;Original
1076971;May the mercy of our True Sovereign be upon us.;Original
1076972;Members of the jury shall remain seated, all else are free to go.;Original
1076973;Met ‘em? We’re good buddies! Hey Ricardo!;Original
1076974;Mmhm… and you saw that snake heading towards her?;Original
1076975;Moving on. Mr. Casca?;Original
1076976;Mr. Beauregard had not even arranged any witnesses to testify on my behalf.;Original
1076977;MR. BEAUREGARD!;Original
1076978;Mr. Beauregard, does this line of inquiry have a point?;Original
1076979;Mr. Beauregard?;Original
1076980;Mr. Casca, are the Ophidian lands under the control of the Britannian government?;Original
1076981;Mr. Casca, of the charges levied against me, which have you failed to demonstrate?;Original
1076982;Mr. Casca, thou mayest begin.;Original
1076983;Mr. Casca, your next witness?;Original
1076984;Mr. Casca?;Original
1076985;Mr. Ricardo, dost thou feel that you canst more truly represent thyself than those who have been, or may be appointed in thine behalf?;Original
1076986;Mr. Ricardo, I doubt you comprehend the ramifications of representing thyself.;Original
1076987;Mr. Ricardo, you are hereby remanded to the State for execution.;Original
1076988;Mr. Ricardo? Thou understandeth that ye are in no position to dictate the course of this affair?;Original
1076989;My client is innocent!;Original
1076990;My defender seems to be asleep.;Original
1076991;My friends, I walk amongst you as a stranger to your culture, and to your ways.;Original
1076992;My friends, there is no body and there is, no, crime.;Original
1076993;My people, the Elves of Heartwood, were long separated from our brethren the Britannians.;Original
1076994;Never met her in my life, Your Honor. Although…;Original
1076995;No!;Original
1076996;No! Instead, we found them building machines of horrible power deep within the earth.;Original
1076997;No, today, Justice cannot yield to mercy, even as Compassion was never shown to all those who paid the price for Ricardo’s crimes.;Original
1076998;No, Your Honor.;Original
1076999;No, Your Honor. Motion to delay?;Original
1077000;No, Your Honor. The Prosecution rests.;Original
1077001;Nor the ones that destroyed the thousands of lives lost during the war.;Original
1077002;Nothing further, Mr. Ricardo?;Original
1077003;Now this young lady was kind, generous, altogether virtuous, and quite beloved of the townspeople.;Original
1077004;Objection noted. Please proceed.;Original
1077005;Objection! Hearsay!;Original
1077006;Objection! Leading the witness!;Original
1077007;Objection, Your Honor!;Original
1077008;Oh no! We fought ‘em, we did. I had me trusty crossbow at me side.;Original
1077009;Oh, well then, thank you.;Original
1077010;Oh.;Original
1077011;Oh? And why was that?;Original
1077012;On the charge of High Treason, how does the jury find the defendant?;Original
1077013;One moment it was quiet, the next the jungle was a full of ‘em. They were everywhere.;Original
1077014;One moment Mr. Ricardo.;Original
1077015;One, Compass or imagine the death of our lord the Sovereign; or the Sovereign’s companion; or their heir, or;Original
1077016;One, that Ricardo is the same Ricardo accused in the matter of this trial.;Original
1077017;Order!;Original
1077018;Our only wish is that the jury carefully hear all the evidence presented from this point forward.;Original
1077019;Overruled. That was for clarification. The witness may answer.;Original
1077020;Please answer.;Original
1077021;Please read it.;Original
1077022;Proceed, but tread carefully Mr. Ricardo.;Original
1077023;Proceed.;Original
1077024;Proceed.;Original
1077025;Ricardo did not wield the bardiche that cut short Liane’s life.;Original
1077026;Ricardo.;Original
1077027;Right, then.;Original
1077028;Second, that Ricardo committed, and did in fact admit to, the theft of the Scion’s Zenith.;Original
1077029;She lived with her family in a sleepy little village, and lived a humble yet blissful life.;Original
1077030;Sir, may I inquire as to your profession?;Original
1077031;So noted.;Original
1077032;So, it seemeth my friend Mr. Casca wisheth to establish a most sad tale of woe! Is that it, Hudson?;Original
1077033;Some may be confused by the elegant words you heard Lord Francesco speak. Please don’t be.;Original
1077034;Someone help me catch her!;Original
1077035;Soon enough the guards were down, and the barriers around the town, they just weren’t working.;Original
1077036;Soon we were all running for the shore – figured we could swim if we couldn’t get through the trees.;Original
1077037;Stop! Stop I say!;Original
1077038;Sure. I’m a fence.;Original
1077039;Sustained!;Original
1077040;Sustained.;Original
1077041;Sustained. Mr. Beauregard, this man is not on trial. Change your line of questioning.;Original
1077042;Tell me, then, did Ricardo not aid an old woman locked in a dungeon? Surely the Council is aware of this incident?;Original
1077043;Thank you Hudson.;Original
1077044;Thank you, I’m finished.;Original
1077045;Thank you, Lord Francesco.;Original
1077046;Thank you, sir.;Original
1077047;Thank you, Your Honor.;Original
1077048;Thank you.;Original
1077049;Thank you.;Original
1077050;Thank you. Is there any additional text concerning the definition of High Treason?;Original
1077051;Thank you. Not bad for a thief, eh?;Original
1077052;Thank you. Your Honor, I call my next witness to the stand.;Original
1077053;That man is Ricardo, the so-called legendary thief.;Original
1077054;That man, ladies and gentlemen, is seated before us.;Original
1077055;That their sole, and greatest duty, be that the Truth come forward, and upon that foundation a fate be determined.;Original
1077056;That they decide only upon the facts of this case.;Original
1077057;That trust tells me that you must act in accordance with those laws. I have laid them plainly before you.;Original
1077058;That was acceptable.;Original
1077059;That’s right.;Original
1077060;That’s… it?;Original
1077061;That's immaterial - they're monsters.;Original
1077062;The Act allows the Council to define new and specific instances of Treason.;Original
1077063;The charge of Theft, at this point, may unduly influence the decision on the charge of Treason. Also, the charge of Conspiracy cannot be substantiated.;Original
1077064;The clerk shall read the charges against the Defendant and report his pleas.;Original
1077065;The conditions are not only met, but are exceeded.;Original
1077066;The court finds the defendant guilty of High Treason.;Original
1077067;The court finds the defendant innocent. Mr. Ricardo, you are free to go.;Original
1077068;The court shall disregard, and the Defense will keep observations of the Court to themselves.;Original
1077069;The crown thing? Sure. Broke it up for for the rares: gold, jewels, you know.;Original
1077070;The Defendant will remain silent.;Original
1077071;The Defendant, Ricardo, has pleaded Not Guilty to the following charges:;Original
1077072;The Defense shall refute the claims of the Prosecution, and prove, or at least provide some reasonable shred of doubt, that Ricardo is innocent of the crimes attributed him.;Original
1077073;The findings are:;Original
1077074;The findings of the Investigating Magistrate are not a matter for debate. Continue.;Original
1077075;The jury will disregard testimony concerning Inu the Crone - irrelevance.;Original
1077076;The jury will now decide the facts of this case, and render a verdict of Guilty or Innocent for the charge of High Treason.;Original
1077077;the Justices shall tarry without any going to Judgement of the Treason till the Cause be shewed and declared before the Sovereign and his Council,;Original
1077078;The least I can be allowed is a chance to speak. Is this not fair?;Original
1077079;The magic ones, you know, that protect cities. All of ‘em have ‘em.;Original
1077080;The man you see sitting before thee is but a pitiful pawn in a game of chess.;Original
1077081;The Ophidians and Terathans, you mean?;Original
1077082;The Ophidians hunted down every man, woman, and child they could find in that city, and slaughtered them without mercy.;Original
1077083;The People calls Hudson of Papua to the stand.;Original
1077084;The People calls Nicholas to the stand;Original
1077085;The Prosecution has failed to establish a link between the assault on the prison transport and any conspiracy on the part of the defendant.;Original
1077086;The Prosecution has failed, you see, to actually prove a crime was committed.;Original
1077087;The Prosecution has submitted its case to the court quite plainly.;Original
1077088;The Prosecution hath concluded its opening statement.;Original
1077089;The prosecution will show beyond any reasonable doubt that Ricardo’s theft of the Scion’s Zenith, an artifact of great importance to the Ophidians, was the direct cause of the war.;Original
1077090;The Prosecution wishes to dismiss the charges of Theft and Conspiracy against the defendant.;Original
1077091;The Prosecution wishes to submit the findings of Justice Edgar, juge d’instruction for this case, as People’s Exhibit the First.;Original
1077092;The record does so show.;Original
1077093;The record shows the findings as People’s Exhibit the First, and that Justice Edgar was the Investigating Magistrate for this trial.;Original
1077094;The Royal Council has determined that the acts Ricardo committed amount to High Treason.;Original
1077095;Theft, namely of a foreign national treasure.;Original
1077096;Then thou mayest proceed.;Original
1077097;Then we will proceed to closing statements. Mr. Casca?;Original
1077098;They do not, for they cannot.;Original
1077099;They submit to you, as do I, as does Britannia herself, that Ricardo’s actions resulted in the needless deaths of thousands.;Original
1077100;They were all over the docks, so I climbed a tree. Turned out they never found me up there.;Original
1077101;Third, that a band of brigands did assault the transport carriage of Ricardo during his relocation to Yew.;Original
1077102;This court is now in session. Please be seated.;Original
1077103;This court is now open for the trial of criminal cases with and without jury.;Original
1077104;This government has given itself the power to destroy any one of us by simply rewriting laws.;Original
1077105;This has also been corroborated by a witness who had personal dealings with Ricardo.;Original
1077106;This is the Court of Truth, Mr. Ricardo, dost thou so swear?;Original
1077107;This is unfortunate, dost thou have any further witnesses?;Original
1077108;Those snakes and spiders, ya ‘know, the monsters.;Original
1077109;Thou mayest do so.;Original
1077110;Three, Counterfeit the Royal Seal; or any of the Sovereign’s money, or;Original
1077111;Two, Levy war against the Sovereign in their Realm; or adhere to the Sovereign’s enemies in their Realm; giving them aid or comfort in their Realm or elsewhere, or;Original
1077112;Ah, Your Honor, I believe he is referring to Ricardo picking a lock for some mercenaries.;Original
1077113;Very well, and again, good afternoon to you all.;Original
1077114;Very well, let the record show that we hath concluded opening statements.;Original
1077115;Very well, the charges of Theft and Conspiracy are hereby dropped.;Original
1077116;Wait, is this the same woman who just willfully obstructed the court?;Original
1077117;We define this instance as: "A willful act that results in great loss of life and property.";Original
1077118;We have.;Original
1077119;We judge his crime Treason most High.;Original
1077120;We will further show that Ricardo, in doing so, invoked a war upon our shores like none seen in recent memory.;Original
1077121;We will justify our call for the maximum penalty. This was a crime committed against all Britannia.;Original
1077122;We will prove that Ricardo has committed High Treason, and we will demonstrate the law to which he will be held.;Original
1077123;We’d had our fair share of trouble with the neighbors, but it’d been right calm since we’d become a part of the Kingdom proper.;Original
1077124;Well I shall tell thee!;Original
1077125;Well, well… well. So… you saw this scared, little, child of a girl run into this building all by herself?;Original
1077126;What happened then?;Original
1077127;What happened then?;Original
1077128;What of this “blackrock” then? These strange magics and a rogue Ophidian queen?;Original
1077129;What the government of Britannia wishes is for me to die, not to receive Justice.;Original
1077130;What the jury must decide, though, is the validity of the Kingdom’s complaint.;Original
1077131;What?;Original
1077132;When you say barriers…;Original
1077133;When you say neighbors, whom do you mean?;Original
1077134;Where, I ask, was this vaunted Royal Council, that so easily passes judgment, in our time of need?;Original
1077135;Where, I ask, were the mages to protect the barriers around our cities?;Original
1077136;Where, I ask, were the soldiers when Papua was attacked?;Original
1077137;whether it ought to be judged Treason or other Felony.;Original
1077138;Which incident is that?;Original
1077139;Wholeheartedly.;Original
1077140;Why aren’t questions being asked?;Original
1077141;Why art thou here, Nick?;Original
1077142;Why, the door behind which Inu the Crone lay prisoner!;Original
1077143;Would the jury foreman please stand.;Original
1077144;Yes sir, I am. What’s left of it at least.;Original
1077145;Yes, there is a specific clause extending the definition.;Original
1077146;Yes, Your Honor!;Original
1077147;Yes, Your Honor, just a moment more.;Original
1077148;Yes, Your Honor, unless I were to represent myself before the court.;Original
1077149;Yes, Your Honor.;Original
1077150;Yes.;Original
1077151;Yes?;Original
1077152;Yet here I stand now, a citizen, yearning to do Justice by the laws and codes that have built our great society.;Original
1077153;Yet, you see my friends, Liane died under an Ophidian's blade, true! But it was a Man who sealed her fate.;Original
1077154;You can’t stop fate! They come! Oh they come!;Original
1077155;You sat there, armed with a crossbow, and watched a girl get killed, doing nothing?!;Original
1077156;You see, ladies and gentlemen, Liane lived in Papua, a territory of Britannia in the Lost Lands, and the first city to suffer under the sudden onslaught of the Ophidian army.;Original
1077157;You there! Halt!;Original

1077170;Your Honor, the Prosecution is most distressed by the behavior of the Defense.;Original

1077577;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Cast fireballs and lightning bolts against monsters there until you have raised your Magery skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings. You seek to unlock the secrets of the arcane art of Magery. The New Haven Mage Council has an assignment for you. Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven. We need your assistance in cleansing the town of this evil influence. Old Haven is located east of here. I suggest using your offensive Magery spells such as Fireball and Lightning Bolt against the Undead that inhabit there.<BR><BR>Make sure you have plenty of reagents before embarking on your journey. Reagents are required to cast Magery spells. You can purchase extra reagents at the nearby Reagent shop, or you can find reagents growing in the nearby wooded areas. You can see which reagents are required for each spell by looking in your spellbook.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.;Original
1077578;Very well, come back to me when you are ready to practice Magery. You have so much arcane potential. 'Tis a shame to see it go to waste. The New Haven Mage Council could really use your help.;Original

1077581;Well done! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this staff. Normally a mage must unequip weapons before spell casting. While wielding your new Ember Staff, however, you will be able to invoke your Magery spells.<BR><BR>Even if you do not currently possess skill in Mace Fighting, the Ember Staff will allow you to fight as if you do. However, your Magery skill will be temporarily reduced while doing so.<BR><BR>Finally, the Ember Staff occasionally smites a foe with a Fireball while wielding it in melee combat. I hope the Ember Staff serves you well.;Original

1077597;Stopping the World;Original
1077598;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and meditate there until you have raised your Meditation skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well met! I can teach you how to 'Stop the World' around you and focus your inner energies on replenishing your mana. What is mana? Mana is the life force for everyone who practices arcane arts. When a practitioner of magic invokes a spell or scribes a scroll, it consumes mana. Having an abundant supply of mana is vital to excelling as a practitioner of the arcane. Those of us who study the art of Meditation are also known as stoics. The Meditation skill allows stoics to increase the rate at which they regenerate mana.<BR><BR>A stoic needs to perform abilities or cast spells to deplete mana before he can meditate to replenish it. Meditation can occur passively or actively. Actively Meditation is more difficult to master but allows for the stoic to replenish mana at a significantly faster rate. Metal armor interferes with the regenerative properties of Meditation. It is wise to wear leather or cloth protection when meditating.<BR><BR>Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use spells and abilities to deplete your mana and actively meditate to replenish it.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Stoic and I will reward you with an arcane prize.;Original

1077601;Splendid! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this hat. When worn, the Philosopher's Hat will protect you somewhat from physical attacks. The Philosopher's Hat also enhances the potency of your offensive spells, lowers the mana cost of your arcane spells and abilities, and passively increases your mana regeneration rate. Ah yes, I almost forgot. The Philosopher's Hat also grants one other special ability to its wearer. It allows a chance for the wearer to cast spells without using any reagents. I hope the Philosopher's Hat serves you well.;Original

Do these activities until you have raised your Evaluating Intelligence skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hello. Truly knowing your opponent is essential for landing your offensive spells with precision. I can teach you how to enhance the effectiveness of your offensive spells, but first you must learn how to size up your opponents intellectually. I have a scholarly task for you.

1077609;The Rudiments of Self Defense;Original
1077610;Go into the New Haven Dueling Pits and engage in hand to hand combat with the combat instructors until you have raised your Wrestling skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Listen up! If you want to learn the rudiments of self-defense, you need toughen up, and there's no better way to toughen up than engaging in combat. Go into the New Haven Dueling Pits and engage in hand to hand combat with the combat instructors. Afraid of dying, you say? Well, you should be! Being an adventurer isn't a bed of posies, or roses, or however that saying goes. If you do take a dirt nap, go to one of the nearby wandering healers and they'll get you back on your feet.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Wrestler and I will reward you with a prize.;Original

1077613;It's about time! Looks like you managed to make it through your self-defense training. As I promised, here's a little something for you. When worn, these Gloves of Safeguarding will increase your awareness and resistances to most everything expect poison. Oh yeah, they also increase your natural health regeneration as well. Pretty handy gloves, indeed.<BR><BR>Oh, if you are wondering if your meditating will be hindered while wearing these gloves, it won't be.

1077615;Scribing Arcane Knowledge;Original
1077616;While here at the New Haven Magery Library, use a scribe's pen and scribe and 3rd and 4th circle Magery scrolls that you have in your spellbook. Remember, you will need blank scrolls as well. Do this until you have raised your Inscription skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings and welcome to the New Haven Magery Library! You wish to learn how to scribe spell scrolls? You have come to the right place! Inscribed in a steady hand and imbued with the power of reagents, a scroll can mean the difference between life and death in a perilous situation. Those knowledgeable in Inscription may transcribe spells to create useful and valuable magical scrolls.<BR><BR>Before you inscribe a spell, you must first be able to cast the spell without the aid of a scroll. This means that you need the appropriate level of proficiency as a mage, the required mana, and the required reagents. Second, you will need a blank scroll to write on and a scribe's pen. Then, you will need to decide which particular spell you wish to scribe. It may sound easy, but there is a bit more to it. As with the development of all skills, you need to practice Inscription of lower level spells before you can move onto the more difficult ones.<BR><BR>The most important aspect of Inscription is mana. Inscribing a scroll with a magic spell drains your mana. When inscribing 3rd circle or lower spells this will not be much of a problem for these spells consume a small amount of mana. However, when you are inscribing higher circle spells, you may see your mana drain rapidly. When this happens, pause or meditate before continuing.<BR><BR>I suggest you begin scribing any 3rd and 4th circle spells that you know. If you don't possess any, you can always barter with one of the local mage merchants or a fellow adventurer that is a seasoned Scribe.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Scribe and I will reward you with an arcane prize.;Original
1077617;I understand. When you are ready, feel free to return to me for Inscription training. Thanks for stopping by!;Original
1077618;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Scribe. Return to Jillian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.;Original
1077619;Scribing is a very fulfilling pursuit. I am pleased to see you embark on this journey. You sling a pen well! On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this spellbook. When equipped, the Hallowed Spellbook greatly enhances the potency of your offensive spells, especially when used on Undead. Be mindful, though. While this book is equipped, when you invoke your powerful spells and abilities vs. Humanoids such as other humans, orcs, ettins, trolls, and the like, your offensive spells will diminish in effectiveness. I suggest unequipping the Hallowed Spellbook when battling Humanoids. I hope this spellbook serves you well.;Original

1077621;Defying the Arcane;Original
1077623;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Battle spell casting monsters there until you have raised your Resisting Spells skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met! To become a true master of the arcane art of Magery, I suggest learning the complementary skill known as Resisting Spells. While the name of this skill may suggest that it helps with resisting all spells, this is not the case. This skill helps you lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time. It does not lessen damage from spells such as Energy Bolt or Flamestrike.<BR><BR>The Magery spells that can be resisted are Clumsy, Curse, Feeblemind, Mana Drain, Mana Vampire, Paralyze, Paralyze Field, Poison, Poison Field, and Weaken.<BR><BR>The Necromancy spells that can be resisted are Blood Oath, Corpse Skin, Mind Rot, and Pain Spike.<BR><BR>At higher ranks, the Resisting Spells skill also benefits you by adding a bonus to your minimum elemental resists. This bonus is only applied after all other resist modifications - such as from equipment - has been calculated. It's also not cumulative. It compares the number of your minimum resists to the calculated value of your modifications and uses the higher of the two values.<BR><BR>As you can see, Resisting Spells is a difficult skill to understand, and even more difficult to master. This is because in order to improve it, you will have to put yourself in harm's way - as in the path of one of the above spells.<BR><BR>Undead have plagued the town of Old Haven. We need your assistance in cleansing the town of this evil influence. Old Haven is located east of here. Battle the undead spell casters that inhabit there.<BR><BR>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Mage and I will reward you with an arcane prize.;Original
1077624;The ability to resist powerful spells is a taxing experience. I understand your resistance in wanting to pursue it. If you wish to reconsider, feel free to return to me for Resisting Spells training. Good journey to you!;Original
1077625;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Mage (for Resisting Spells). Return to Alefian in New Haven to receive your arcane prize.;Original
1077626;You have successfully begun your journey in becoming a true master of Magery. On behalf of the New Haven Mage Council I wish to present you with this bracelet.

1077634;Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Mage profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Kaelynna teaches Magery. I suggest seeking her out first. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle.<BR><BR>Gustar teaches Meditation. This skill allows someone to regenerate mana at an accelerated rate.<BR><BR>Mithneral teaches Evaluating Intelligence. This skill greatly enhances offensive Magery spells. Evaluating Intelligence also allows mages to 'size up' the mental capabilities of an opponent.<BR><BR>Dimethro teaches Wrestling. This skill enhances defense capabilities while in combat. Opponents will have a harder time landing blows against mages while they are spell casting.<BR><BR>Jillian teaches Inscription. This skill allows scribes to create scrolls that can be added to spellbooks. Inscription also slightly enhances a mage's offensive spells.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Resisting Spells which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Dimethro is located near the entrance to the New Haven dueling pits.

1077637;So they send ya’ ta’ me to get ya’ outfitted. Well then ya’ need to get a few things. I would recommend the katana, as there’s nothing better than three feet of steel to make anything think twice ‘bout attackin’ ya’. Tell ya’ what, head over ta’ that table there, and get me that katana, I need to look at it to be sure its fit to skewer the un-naturals up ahead. Oh… and you can keep anything else ya’ pick up.;Original
1077638;Well then, ya’ ain’t getting through that gate until you bring me that katana.;Original
1077639;That’s it, a good soldier learns ta’ follow orders. Bring it ta' me fer yer reward.;Original
1077640;Here ya’ go, it looks plenty strong enough ta’ me. Oh... and best work on keeping yer eyes open, I slipped it into yer bag when you wasn’t lookin’. Haha!;Original
1077641;Try that there katana. The long, metal one... with the sharp edge on it.;Original
1077642;Greetings Traveler, and welcome to world of Sosaria. I am Gwen. I am here to help newcomers learn the basic skills needed to survive and prosper in your travels to come.The first objective is to find your footing, and learn to walk.When you hold down the Right Mouse Button you will move towards your mouse cursor.If you hold the cursor close to yourself, you will walk. If you move the cursor further away, you will run.Try it now. Move forward into the supply depot ahead, and click the Next button when you are there and ready to proceed.;Original
1077643;Take a look around, you will notice that when your cursor passes over some things they glow. This signifies that you are able to interact with the object.Many things you find, you will be able to pick up and carry. You have a backpack to carry these items in. Press “”, or click on the Backpack Icon on the lower right bar at the bottom of the screen, to open your backpack.You can’t pick up these crates, they are far too heavy, but to open them and look inside, you only need to Double Left Click your mouse on them. The container will open and show you the contents within.When you find an object that you want to take, you will want to Left Click on it and Drag it into your backpackAlso, if your backpack is not open, and you’re picking something up in a hurry, you can Left Click and Drag the item onto your character, and it will drop into your backpack as well.There is food and a few other goodies in the crates and barrels, go ahead and grab some for yourself.  Then click the Next button when you have collected enough and are ready to go on.;Original
1077644;Well done! Now approach the guard ahead of you. He is the Keeper of Ol’ Haven, and he has a task for you.To speak with him, you will need to Double Left Click on him.He will open a Quest window, please read it and accept the quest to proceed.When you have the Item, you will need to Toggle it as a Quest Item. To do this, Left Click on yourself, and select Toggle Quest Item from the context menu. A Targeting Cursor should appear. Then Left Click on the Item in your backpack to mark it as a quest item.Once you have completed the task for him, click the next button to continue.;Original
1077645;Great! You got past that mangy old bandit. But he got you hooked up with some good equipment. Let’s open your bag and see what you got. Well… not the greatest items ever made, but they will do. So, let’s get you equipped. Click on the Paperdoll icon on the lower right of your screen, this is the window that shows us what you are wearing and carrying. Left Click and Drag the Sword in your backpack to your hand slot in the Paperdoll. This will put the sword in your hand.To equip any item in your backpack, you will have to be sure the slot you want to put it in is empty, and then you will left click and drag the item to the slot.Try it now with a helmet.Once you are properly equipped and ready for battle, click the next button.;Original
1077646;Alright, looks like your ready to go. To get out of here and on to New Haven, you’ll first have to pass the upcoming tests. Open your Radar map. You’ll notice a little gold marker on the map <Flash/Highlight Radar map>. That is the waypoint where the gate is. Your tests will begin on the other side of that gate. Follow the alley towards the marker, and click the next button when you get there.;Original
1077647;Beyond this gate is your first challenge. Something has been reanimating the former residents of the destroyed town of Haven, and your first test will be to free one of the skeletons from it unrest, and return it to the grave.There are a couple things you need to know before entering.First you will need to set your self in War mode. Do this by clicking on the Combat Toggle button on the bar at the bottom center of your screen. While in War mode you will be able to Double Left Click on a target to attack with your weapon or cast offensive spells on them. This will set you in auto attack mode, so that you don’t have to keep clicking the target to continue attacking. Your weapon speed will determine how fast you will repeat the attack.You may also notice the two Special Attack icons located near the Combat Toggle. These Attacks are determined by the type of weapon you have equipped. Most special attacks require a certain level of skill with the weapon to perform.When you are finished with combat remember to set yourself back into Peace Mode using the same button, as you don’t want to attack everyone you interact with.When you feel comfortable with the Combat Toggle, Double Left Click the gate ahead of you to proceed.Once you have successfully Killed a Skeleton, Click the Next button;Original
1077648;You Killed one! Good job. You should check it to see if it was carrying anything of value.To do this, Double Left Click on the corpse of the creature before you. A window will appear that has any items that are left on the corpse. If there is anything you want to take,  Left Click and Drag the items to your inventory.I suggest taking all the items on this corpse.When you have collected all the items, click the Next button to continue.;Original
1077649;Very good. Now when you are hurt, or have taken any damage, it’s a good idea to heal up before going into battle again. You should have a Potion of healing that you found on the corpse in your inventory, if you don’t, check the corpse again; maybe you forgot to pick it up.To use the potion, Double Left Click on it in your inventory, and you will drink it.Watch your Health Bar to see your hit points regenerate.Now, you should have that Scroll of Magic Arrow. If you do not, check the corpse to be sure you didn’t miss it.Scrolls, and other items, like the healing potion or bandages, can be put into your “hotbar” on the bottom left of your screen.Left click and Drag the Scroll from your inventory to an open slot on the hotbar.Don’t use that scroll yet, you will need it against your next opponentWhen your scroll is properly loaded and you are all healed up, head to the next waypoint on your radar. Click the Next button when you arrive at the gate.;Original
1077650;Alright, the zombies beyond this gate are aggressive, but you have proven to be pretty good with your weapon thus far and I think you’ll do just fine.But before you go in there you should know how to cast that Magic ArrowWhen you are in War mode, and have a zombie targeted, just Left Click on the scroll icon in the hotbar to cast the spell at it. If that doesn’t kill it completely then you will need to engage it in hand to hand combat to defeat it.And be careful to avoid the other zombies out there, as I said, they can be quite aggressiveClick the Next button when you run into problems *winks*;Original
1077651;Oh No! They got you… how terribly sad. But all hope is not lost.Death in the world of Sosaria is not a trivial thing, but neither is it the end of your adventures. You may notice the world has turned grey, and that you’re dressed very differently. That is because you are a ghost and now exist in a Spirit state. In this state you cannot interact with the living, but some of them can interact with you. Those that have skill in Spirit Speak can both see and communicate with you. They know how to tap into the spirit realm, and how to use its powers for healing as well.I have marked the location of a healer on your radar map; he will be able to resurrect you, but once your resurrected you will have only 15 minutes to return to your body and collect your equipment from your corpse, otherwise it will decay and you will not be able to get it back. Keep this in mind when your out, wandering the world on your own.Go to the healer and get resurrected. Click the Next button once you are back among the living;Original
1077652;Alright, we are back in business again. Now you will have a waypoint back to your corpse. You should run back there and gather all your belongings. To gather your things, just Double Left click on your corpse and it will all re-equip you as you were when you were killed. Once you have all your things back in their proper places (which will happen automatically), open your backpack. You will find a small gift from me. It’s a Token of Passage that will allow you get through the gate that I have marked on your map.Head through that gate, and click the Next button.;Original
1077653;Uh oh… he’s back again. I don’t see a way to slip past him. Looks like you’re going to have to talk to him.Click the Next button if you survive.;Original
1077654;This gate will lead you out of here, and on the road to New Haven. It’s a town of learning. A Place where you will get trained and learn how to advance in all of the skills vital to your prosperity in the world of Sosaria. I have marked the location of the person who will guide you through that learning on your radar map. I strongly suggest going to there now, the knowledge you will pick up will be invaluable.I wish you the best, and may all your adventures be great!;Original
1077655;Well, well.. Another youngling. You are here to prove your mettle. I think you have none. But there is some persistence in you; you may learn to wield that weapon someday.Tell you what, when you get some training under your belt and feel you have mastered your arts, come find me, so I can eliminate those who seek to keep this world from dark clutches, from MY clutches.Take this Rune.. And when you feel you have mastered your skills.. Come and find me. I will be waiting. ;Original
1077656;The Warrior's Path;Original
1077657;Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Warrior profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will probably want to talk to him first since knowing how to handle a weapon is the first step on the path to mastering the art of surviving on the path to becoming a warrior. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon doesn’t really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a warrior, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt; sometimes badly. Knowing how to heal yourself and your allies is an invaluable skill for any warrior.<BR><BR>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a warrior in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent's strength and dexterity.<BR><BR>Sarsmea Smythe teaches Focus. The ability to balance yourself physically and mentally can help a warrior stay fresh both in body and spirit.<BR><BR>Tyl Ariadne teaches Parrying. The more skilled you are at deflecting your opponent's blows, the longer you'll last in battle.<BR><BR>May your sword stay sharp, your mace heavy and your kryss, um...pointy!;Original
1077658;The Way of the Blade;Original
1077659;You feel much more attuned to your blade. Your ability to hone your Swordsmanship skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077660;You feel less attuned to your blade. Your Swordsmanship learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077661;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. While wielding your sword, battle monsters there until you have raised your Swordsmanship skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>*As you approach, you notice Jockles sizing you up with a skeptical look on his face*<br><br>I can see you want to learn how to handle a blade. It's a lot harder than it looks, and you're going to have to put in a lot of time and effort if you ever want to be half as good as I am.<br><br>I'll tell you what, kid, I'll help you get started, but you're going to have to do all the work if you want to learn something. East of here, outside of town, is Old Haven. It's been overrun with the nastiest sort of undead you've seen, which makes it the perfect place for you to turn that sloppy grin on your face into actual skill at handling a sword.<br><br>Make sure you have a sturdy Swordsmanship weapon in good repair before you leave. 'Tis no fun to travel all the way down there just to find out that you forgot your blade!<br><br>When you feel that you've cut down enough of those foul smelling things to learn to handle a blade without hurting yourself, come back to me. If I think you've improved enough, I'll give you something suited for a real warrior.;Original
1077662;Ha! I had a feeling you were a lily-livered pansy. You might have potential, but if you're scared by a few smelly undead, maybe it's better that you stay away from sharp objects. After all, you wouldn't want to hurt yourself swinging a sword. If you change your mind, I might give you another chance...maybe.;Original
1077663;*Jockles look you up and down*<br><br>Come on! You've got to work harder than that to get better. Now get out of here, go kill some more of those undead to the east in Old Haven, and don't come back till you've got some real skill.;Original
1077664;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Swordsman. Return to Jockles in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you. Hopefully he'll be a little nicer this time!;Original
1077665;Well, well, look at what we have here! You managed to do it after all. I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you came back in one piece, but since you did, I've got a little something for you.<br><br>This is fine blade that served me well in my younger days. Of course I've got much better swords at my disposal now, so I'll let you go ahead and use it under one condition. Take good care of it and treat it with the respect that a fine sword deserves.<br><br>You're one of the quickest learners I've seen, but you still have a ways to go. Keep at it, and you'll get there someday. Happy hunting, kid.;Original
1077666;Jockles' Quicksword;Original
1077667;The Art of War;Original
1077668;You feel like practicing combat here would really help you learn to fight better. Your ability to raise your Tactics skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077669;You feel less able to absorb the lessons of combat. Your Tactics learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077670;Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there until you have raised your Tactics skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Knowing how to hold a weapon is only half of the battle. The other half is knowing how to use it against an opponent. It's one thing to kill a few bunnies now and then for fun, but a true warrior knows that the right moves to use against a lich will pretty much get your arse fried by a dragon.<br><br>I'll help teach you how to fight so that when you do come up against that dragon, maybe you won't have to walk out of there "OooOOooOOOooOO'ing" and looking for a healer.<br><br>There are some undead that need cleaning out in Old Haven towards the east. Why don't you head on over there and practice killing things?<br><br>When you feel like you've got the basics down, come back to me and I'll see if I can scrounge up an item to help you in your adventures later on.;Original
1077671;That's too bad. I really thought you had it in you. Well, I'm sure those undead will still be there later, so if you change your mind, feel free to stop on by and I'll help you the best I can.;Original
1077672;You're making some progress, that I can tell, but you're not quite good enough to last for very long out there by yourself. Head back to Old Haven, to the east, and kill some more undead.;Original
1077673;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior. Return to Alden Armstrong in New Haven to claim your reward.;Original
1077674;Hey, good job killing those undead! Hopefully someone will come along and clean up the mess. All that blood and guts tends to stink after a few days, and when the wind blows in from the east, it can raise a mighty stink!<br><br>Since you performed valiantly, please take these arms and use them well. I've seen a few too many harvests to be running around out there myself, so you might as well take it.<br><br>There is a lot left for you to learn, but I think you'll do fine. Remember to keep your elbows in and stick'em where it hurts the most!;Original
1077675;Arms of Armstrong;Original
1077676;Bruises, Bandages and Blood;Original
1077677;You feel fresh and are eager to heal wounds. Your ability to improve your Healing skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077678;You feel as if you've seen enough blood to last a lifetime. Your Healing learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077679;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Heal yourself and other players until you have raised your Healing skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Ah, welcome to my humble practice. I am Avicenna, New Haven's resident Healer. A lot of adventurers head out into the wild from here, so I keep rather busy when they come back bruised, bleeding, or worse.<br><br>I can teach you how to bandage a wound, sure, but it's not a job for the queasy! For some folks, the mere sight of blood is too much for them, but it's something you'll get used to over time. It is one thing to cut open a living thing, but it's quite another to sew it back up and save it from sure death. 'Tis noble work, healing.<br><br>Best way for you to practice fixing up wounds is to head east out to Old Haven and either practice binding up your own wounds, or practice on someone else. Surely they'll be grateful for the assistance.<br><br>Make sure to take enough bandages with you! You don't want to run out in the middle of a tough fight.;Original
1077680;No? Are you sure? Well, when you feel that you're ready to practice your healing, come back to me. I'll be right here, fixing up adventurers and curing the occasional cold!;Original
1077681;Hail! 'Tis good to see you again. Unfortunately, you're not quite ready to call yourself an Apprentice Healer quite yet. Head back out to Old Haven, due east from here, and bandage up some wounds. Yours or someone else's, it doesn't much matter.;Original
1077682;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Healer. Return to Avicenna in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.;Original
1077683;Hello there, friend. I see you've returned in one piece, and you're an Apprentice Healer to boot! You should be proud of your accomplishment, as not everyone has "the touch" when it comes to healing.<br><br>I can't stand to see such good work go unrewarded, so I have something I'd like you to have. It's not much, but it'll help you heal just a little faster, and maybe keep you alive.<br><br>Good luck out there, friend, and don't forget to help your fellow adventurer whenever possible!;Original
1077684;Healer's Touch;Original
1077685;Know Thine Enemy;Original
1077686;You feel very willing to learn more about the body. Your ability to hone your Anatomy skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077687;You lose your ambition to learn about the body. Your Anatomy skill learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077688;Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters there, or heal yourself and other players, until you have raised your Anatomy skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail and well met. You must be here to improve your knowledge of Anatomy. Well, you've come to the right place because I can teach you what you need to know. At least all you'll need to know for now. Haha!<br><br>Knowing about how living things work inside can be a very useful skill. Not only can you learn where to strike an opponent to hurt him the most, but you can use what you learn to heal wounds better as well. Just walking around town, you can even tell if someone is strong or weak or if they happen to be particularly dexterous or not.<BR><BR>If you're interested in learning more, I'd advise you to head out to Old Haven, just to the east, and jump into the fray. You'll learn best by engaging in combat while keeping you and your fellow adventurers healed, or you can even try sizing up your opponents.<br><br>While you're gone, I'll dig up something you may find useful.;Original
1077689;It's your choice, but I wouldn't head out there without knowing what makes those things tick inside! If you change your mind, you can find me right here dissecting frogs, cats or even the occasional unlucky adventurer.;Original
1077690;I'm surprised to see you back so soon. You've still got a ways to go if you want to really understand the science of Anatomy. Head out to Old Haven and practice combat and healing yourself or other adventurers.;Original
1077691;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Healer (for Anatomy). Return to Andreas Vesalius in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.;Original
1077692;By the Virtues, you've done it! Congratulations mate! You still have quite a ways to go if you want to perfect your knowledge of Anatomy, but I know you'll get there someday. Just keep at it.<br><br>In the meantime, here's a piece of armor that you might find useful. It's not fancy, but it'll serve you well if you choose to wear it.<br><br>Happy adventuring, and remember to keep your cranium separate from your clavicle!;Original
1077693;Tunic of Guarding;Original
1077694;Escutcheon de Ariadne;Original
1077695;Clasp of Concentration;Original
1077696;The Inner Warrior;Original
1077697;You feel much more attuned to yourself. Your ability to improve Focus skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077698;You feel like you don't even know yourself anymore! Your Focus learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077699;Head East out of town to Old Haven. Expend stamina and mana until you have raised your Focus skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Well, hello there. Don't you look like quite the adventurer!<br><br>You want to learn more about Focus, do you? I can teach you something about that, but first you should know that not everyone can be disciplined enough to excel at it. Focus is the ability to achieve inner balance in both body and spirit, so that you recover from physical and mental exertion faster than you otherwise would.<br><br>If you want to practice Focus, the best place to do that is east of here, in Old Haven, where you'll find an undead infestation. Exert yourself physically by engaging in combat and moving quickly. For testing your mental balance, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using special moves or abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Go. Train hard, and you will find that your concentration will improve naturally. When you've improved your ability to focus yourself at an Apprentice level, come back to me and I shall give you something worthy of your new ability.;Original
1077700;I'm disappointed. You have a lot of inner potential, and it would pain me greatly to see you waste that. Oh well. If you change your mind, I'll be right here.;Original
1077701;Hello again. I see you've returned, but it seems that your Focus skill hasn't improved as much as it could have. Just head east, to Old Haven, and exert yourself physically and mentally as much as possible. To do this physically, engage in combat and move as quickly as you can. For exerting yourself mentally, expend mana in whatever way you find most suitable to your abilities. Casting spells and using special moves or abilities work well for consuming your mana.<br><br>Return to me when you have gained enough Focus skill to be considered an Apprentice Stoic.;Original
1077702;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Stoic (for Focus). Return to Sarsmea Smythe in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you. ;Original
1077703;Look who it is! I knew you could do it if you just had the discipline to apply yourself. It feels good to recover from battle so quickly, doesn't it? Just wait until you become a Grandmaster, it's amazing!<br><br>Please take this gift, as you've more than earned it with your hard work. It will help you recover even faster during battle, and provides a bit of protection as well.<br><br>You have so much more potential, so don't stop trying to improve your Focus now! Safe travels!;Original
1077704;Thou and Thine Shield;Original
1077705;You feel as light as a butterfly, as if you could block incoming blows easily. Your ability to hone your Parrying skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077706;Your inner butterfly is tired. You're not particularly able to block incoming blows well. Your Parrying learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077707;Head East out of town to Old Haven. Battle monsters, or simply let them hit you, while holding a shield or weapon until you have raised your Parrying skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Oh, hello. You probably want me to teach you how to parry, don't you?<br><br>Very well.<br><br>First, you'll need a weapon or shield. Obviously shields work best of all, but you can parry with a 2-handed weapon. Or if you're feeling particularly brave, a 1-handed weapon will do in a pinch.<br><br>I'd advise you to go to Old Haven, which you'll find the east, and practice blocking incoming blows from the undead there. You'll learn quickly if you have more than one opponent attack you at the same time to practice parrying lots of blows at once. That's the quickest way to master the art of parrying.<br><br>If you manage to improve your skill enough, I have a shield that you might find useful. Come back to me when you've trained to apprentice level.;Original
1077708;It's your choice, obviously, but I'd highly suggest that you learn to parry before adventuring out into the world. Come talk to me again when you get tired of being beat on by your opponents.;Original
1077709;You're doing well, but in my opinion, I don't think you really want to continue on without improving your parrying skill a bit more. Go to Old Haven, to the east, and practice blocking blows with a shield.;Original
1077710;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Warrior (for Parrying). Return to Tyl Ariadne in New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.;Original
1077711;Well done! You're much better at parrying blows than you were when we first met. You should be proud of your newfound ability… and I bet your body is grateful to you as well.<br><br>*Tyl Ariadne laughs loudly at his own (mostly lame) joke*<br><br>Oh yes, I did promise you a shield if I thought you were worthy of having it, so here you go. My father made these shields for the guards who served my family faithfully for many years, and I just happen to have one that I can part with. You should find it useful as you explore the lands.<br><br>Good luck, and may the Virtues be your guide.;Original

1077717;The Call to Chivalry;Original
1077718;Hail, brave knight! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Paladin profession, seek out the following instructors:<BR><BR>Aelorn teaches Chivalry. I suggest talking to him first. Chivalry is the main ability of the Paladin. A Paladin can evoke a number of abilities that can improve his prowess on the battlefield.<BR><BR>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<BR><BR>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<BR><BR>Sarsmea Smythe teaches Focus. The ability to balance yourself physically and mentally can help a Paladin stay fresh both in body and spirit.<BR><BR>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Paladin in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent’s strength and dexterity.<BR><BR>Alefian teaches Resisting Spells which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<BR><BR>Alefian is located at the New Haven Mage School. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<BR><BR>May your enemies feel the wrath of the righteous.;Original
1077719;Cleansing Old Haven;Original
1077720;Your Chivalry potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.;Original
1077721;You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Paladin. Your Chivalry potential is not enhanced here.;Original
1077722;Head East out of town to Old Haven. Consecrate your weapon, cast Divine Fury, and battle monsters there until you have raised your Chivalry skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Hail, friend. The life of a Paladin is a life of much sacrifice, humility, bravery, and righteousness. If you wish to pursue such a life, I have an assignment for you. Adventure east to Old Haven, consecrate your weapon, and lay to rest the undead that inhabit there.<br><br>Each ability a Paladin wishes to invoke will require a certain amount of "tithing points" to use. A Paladin can earn these tithing points by donating gold at a shrine or holy place. You may tithe at this shrine.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Paladin.;Original
1077723;Farewell to you my friend. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Paladin.;Original
1077724;There are still more undead to lay to rest. You still have more to learn. Return to me once you have done so.;Original
1077725;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Paladin. Return to Aelorn in New Haven to report your progress.;Original
1077726;Well done, friend. While I know you understand Chivalry is its own reward, I would like to reward you with something that will protect you in battle. It was passed down to me when I was a lad. Now, I am passing it on you. It is called the Bulwark Leggings. Thank you for your service.;Original

1077730;The Art of Forging Metal;Original
1077731;Hail and well met! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Blacksmith profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>George Hephaestus teaches Blacksmithing. Obviously, knowing how to forge metal into weapons and armor is what defines a blacksmith. He can be found at his shop here in town.<br><br>Amelia Youngstone teaches Tinkering. Tinkering compliments the blacksmith skill as it allows you to craft your own blacksmithing tools, as well as other useful items. Amelia is often found inside of her workshop here in town.<br><br>Jacob Waltz teaches Mining. Without the knowledge of mining ore and smelting, a blacksmith will have to purchase ingots from the market. This greatly cuts into the profit making potential of Blacksmithing. You can find Jacob up in the hills outside of town.<br><br>Kaelynna teaches Magery. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle. The sheer versatility of the Magery skill makes it highly useful to any blacksmith.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. Knowing how to handle a weapon is very important if you want to protect yourself from brigands and monsters. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This skill complements Swordsmanship, as just knowing how to handle a weapon doesn’t really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<br><br>Good luck, and remember that a respected Blacksmith never tries to overcharge for services!;Original
1077732;It’s Hammer Time!;Original
1077733;By using George’s forge and anvil, he is able to give you advice as you create blacksmithing items. This helps you hone your Blacksmithing skill a bit faster than normal.;Original
1077734;You’re not using George’s forge and anvil any longer, and he cannot give you advice. Your Blacksmithing learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077735;Create new daggers and maces using the forge and anvil in George’s shop. Try making daggers up to 45 skill, the switch to making maces until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center>Hail, and welcome to my humble shop. I’m George Hephaestus, New Haven’s blacksmith. I assume that you’re here to ask me to train you to be an Apprentice Blacksmith. I certainly can do that, but you’re going to have to supply your own ingots. <br>You can always buy them at the market, but I highly suggest that you mine your own. That way, any items you sell will be pure profit!<br><br>So, once you have a supply of ingots, use my forge and anvil here to create items. You’ll also need a supply of the proper tools; you can use a smith’s hammer, a sledgehammer or tongs. You can either make them yourself if you have the tinkering skill, or buy them from a tinker at the market.<br><br>Since I’ll be around to give you advice, you’ll learn faster here than anywhere else. Start off making daggers until you reach 45 blacksmithing skill, then switch to maces until you’ve achieved 50. Once you’ve done that, come talk to me and I’ll give you something for your hard work.;Original
1077736;You’re not interested in learning to be a smith, eh? I thought for sure that’s why you were here. Oh well, if you change your mind, you can always come back and talk to me.;Original
1077737;You’re doing well, but you’re not quite there yet. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make daggers up until 45 skill, and then switch to maces. Also, don’t forget that using my forge and anvil will help you learn faster.;Original
1077738;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Blacksmith. Return to George Hephaestus in New Haven to see what kind of reward he has waiting for you.;Original
1077739;I’ve been watching you get better and better as you’ve been smithing, and I have to say, you’re a natural! It’s a long road to being a Grandmaster Blacksmith, but I have no doubt that if you put your mind to it you’ll get there someday. Let me give you one final piece of advice. If you’re smithing just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.<br><br>Now that you’re an Apprentice Blacksmith, I have something for you. While you were busy practicing, I was crafting this hammer for you. It’s finely balanced, and has a bit of magic imbued within that will help you craft better items. However, that magic needs to restore itself over time, so you can only use it so many times per day. I hope you find it useful!;Original
1077740;Hammer of Hephaestus;Original
1077741;The Right Tool for the Job;Original
1077742;By tinkering inside of Amelia’s workshop, she is able to give you advice. This helps you hone your Tinkering skill faster than normal.;Original
1077743;Since you’ve left Amelia’s workshop, she cannot give you advice. Your Tinkering learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077744;Create new daggers and maces while inside Amelia’s workshop. Try making daggers up to 45 skill, the switch to making maces until 50 skill.<br><center>-----</center>Hello! I guess you’re here to learn something about Tinkering, eh? You’ve come to the right place, as Tinkering is what I’ve dedicated my life to. <br><br>You’ll need two things to get started: a supply of ingots and the right tools for the job. You can either buy ingots from the market, or go mine them yourself. As for tools, you can try making your own set of Tinker’s Tools, or if you’d prefer to buy them, I have some for sale.<br><br>Working here in my shop will let me give you pointers as you go, so you’ll be able to learn faster than anywhere else. Start off making scissors until you reach 45 blacksmithing skill, then switch to hammers until you’ve achieved 50. Once you’ve done that, come talk to me and I’ll give you something for your hard work.;Original
1077745;I’m disappointed that you aren’t interested in learning more about Tinkering. It’s really such a useful skill!<br><br>*Amelia smiles*<br><br>At least you know where to find me if you change your mind, since I rarely spend time outside of this shop.;Original
1077746;Nice going! You’re not quite at Apprentice Tinkering yet, though, so you better get back to work. Remember that the quickest way to learn is to make scissors up until 45 skill, and then switch to hammers. Also, don’t forget that working here in my shop will let me give you tips so you can learn faster.;Original
1077747;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Tinker. Talk to Amelia Youngstone in New Haven to see what kind of reward she has waiting for you.;Original
1077748;You’ve done it! Look at our brand new Apprentice Tinker! You’ve still got quite a lot to learn if you want to be a Grandmaster Tinker, but I believe you can do it! Just keep in mind that if you’re tinkering just to practice and improve your skill, make items that are moderately difficult (60-80% success chance), and try to stick to ones that use less ingots.  <br><br>Come here, my brand new Apprentice Tinker, I want to give you something special. I created this just for you, so I hope you like it. It’s a set of Tinker’s Tools that contains a bit of magic. These tool’s will give you a small bonus in skill, but can only be used a small number of times per day. You can even use them to make a normal set of tools, so that way you won’t ever find yourself stuck somewhere with no tools!<br><br>I hope you’ve enjoyed our time together as much as I have. You’ve got a lot of promise, so please don’t waste it! Farewell!;Original

1077751;You can almost smell the ore in the rocks here! Your ability to improve your Mining skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1077752;So many rocks, so little ore… Your potential to increase your Mining skill is no longer enhanced.;Original
1077753;Find Jacob’s Lost Mine and mine iron ore there, using a pickaxe or shovel. Bring it back to Jacob’s forge and smelt the ore into ingots, until you have raised your Mining skill to 50. You may find a packhorse useful for hauling the ore around. The animal trainer in New Haven has packhorses for sale.<br><center>-----</center>Howdy! Welcome to my camp. It’s not much, I know, but it’s all I’ll be needin’ up here. I don’t need them fancy things those townspeople have down there in New Haven. Nope, not one bit. Just me, Bessie, my pick and a thick vein ‘o valorite.<br><br>Anyhows, I’m guessin’ that you’re up here to ask me about minin’, aren’t ya? Well, don’t be expectin’ me to tell you where the valorite’s at, cause I ain’t gonna tell the King of Britannia, much less the likes of you. But I will show ya how to mine and smelt iron, cause there certainly is a ‘nough of up in these hills.<br><br>*Jacob looks around, with a perplexed look on his face*<br><br>Problem is, I can’t remember where my iron mine’s at, so you’ll have to find it yourself. Once you’re there, have at it with a pickaxe or shovel, then haul it back to camp and I’ll show ya how to smelt it. Ya look a bit wimpy, so you might wanna go buy yourself a packhorse in town from the animal trainer to help you haul around all that ore.<br><br>When you’re an Apprentice Miner, talk to me and I’ll give ya a little somethin’ I’ve got layin’ around here... somewhere.;Original
1077754;Couldn’t find my iron mine, could ya? Well, neither can I!<br><br>*Jacob laughs*<br><br>Oh, ya don’t wanna find it? Well, allrighty then, ya might as well head on back down to town then and stop cluttering up my camp. Come back and talk to me if you’re interested in learnin’ ‘bout minin’.;Original
1077755;Where ya been off a gallivantin’ all day, pilgrim? You ain’t seen no hard work yet! Get yer arse back out there to my mine and dig up some more iron. Don’t forget to take a pickaxe or shovel, and if you’re so inclined, a packhorse too.;Original
1077756;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Miner. Return to Jacob Waltz in at his camp in the hills above New Haven as soon as you can to claim your reward.;Original
1077757;Dang gun it! If that don't beat all! Ya went and did it, didn’t ya? What we got ourselves here is a mighty fine brand spankin’ new Apprentice Miner!<br><br>I can see ya put some meat on them bones too while you were at it!<br><br>Here’s that little somethin’ I told ya I had for ya. It’s a pickaxe with some high falutin’ magic inside that’ll help you find the good stuff when you’re off minin’.

1077773;The Darkness;Original
1077774;To greet you wholeheartedly. To feel thankful for your willingness to help.<br><br>To not be able to see? To think that if the shrines of Compassion, Justice and Sacrifice are involved that it is likely that Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is behind the darkness. To know that such powerful magic can be countered, but to believe that only by seeking the innate power of the opposite can it be done.<br><br>To recommend that you seek out more knowledge at Empath Abbey. To know that the monks there study how Love can overcome Hatred. To want you to take this book to the Keeper of the Flame at Empath Abbey. To suspect that she will understand.<br><br>To wish you good fortune against such a terrible foe.;Original
1077775;To not know what to say. To think that perhaps you do not understand the seriousness of the situation. To hope you return soon to help.;Original
1077776;To wish that you would hurry. To know that there is not much time.;Original
1077777;You've failed to deliver the book to Empath Abbey. Return to Sin'Vraal to get another book.;Original
1077778;Greetings, how may I help thee?<br><br>*Anne listens to your story*<br><br>Oh my! Astaroth you say? Well, Sin'Vraal may very well be right. Let me take a look at the book.;Original
1077779;A Dark Flame;Original
1077780;A Book of Ancient Gargish Prophicies;Original
1077781;I'm sorry, I cannot help thee with that!;Original
1077782;Just from looking at the first few pages, I think SinVraal was correct in sending you to me. I'll need some time to read more to be sure.<br><br>I'm feeling really thirsty though, so can you do me a favor? Fetch me a bottle of ale from the Innkeeper downstairs, and I'll study this while you're gone.;Original
1077783;It's just downstairs! Do you want me to study this book or not?;Original
1077784;You've failed to fetch Anne a bottle of ale! Return to Anne to see if she'll let you get her another bottle of ale.;Original
1077785;Where's my ale? I'm really thirsty!;Original
1077786;Finally! I was getting thirsty. Thank you.<br><br>Ok, so I've read some more of this book, and it does appear that Sin'Vraal's thinking was on track. As I'm sure you know, Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred, is compelled to oppose the Principle of Love and everything related to it. What you may not know is that Love and Hatred are entwined at a very basic level, and one cannot exist without the other to put it in perspective, nor can one become too influential without the other diminishing an equal amount.<br><br>From what I've read in this book, it's clear that by corrupting the shrines and extinguishing the Candle of Love, Astaroth is attempting to spread the influence of Hatred in the world. The more Hatred that exists, the less Love's presence is felt, and the more powerful Astaroth becomes! Obviously, we cannot let the balance swing too far in Astaroth's favor if we are to have any hope of thwarting his future plans.<br><br>The Candle of Love itself is kept in a cavern underneath the Abbey, far below where we're standing now. The entrance to the cavern can be found in the back room of the winery next door. However, the tunnel leading to the cavern is dark, and it seems that no normal light can pierce this unnatural darkness.<br><br>From what we’ve been able to discern, in order to enter this impenetrable curtain of darkness that now enshrouds the cavern, many brave adventurers will need to purify the light from a regular candle and then touch the purified flame to the Candle of Love. However, it all starts with one person... you.<br><br>Quickly, go to each of the three shrines and help cleanse them. Then meditate on each virtue, and the way forward will be shown to you. Only through doing this might you help oppose Astaroth's growing power.;Original

1077875;You feel as if the shrine preferred that you do something else.;Original
1077876;A Compassionate Task;Original
1077877;As you meditate on the virtue of Compassion, you start to feel utter despise towards the human race. The feeling burns intensely in your heart, filling you with blind rage and a compulsion to maim and torture any human that dare enter your home.<br><br>As the feeling begins to fade, you see a vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal, and you somehow know that your path lies in that direction.;Original
1077878;You suddenly feel quite ashamed of yourself.;Original
1077879;You've strayed too far from the path of Compassion. Return to the Shrine of Compassion and meditate some more.;Original
1077880;The vision of a crystal ball resting upon a pedestal returns to your mind.;Original
1077881;You place the blackened heart on the Shrine of Compassion and begin to meditate. Sadness overcomes you as you think about the fate of the ogre. Astaroth's influence in the ogre's life corrupted his heart to the extent that he was so consumed by despise of the human race that his capability to feel content with his life, much less to find true happiness, was completely taken away from him.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the ogre's corrupted heart has been purified by Compassion. You pick up the Heart of Compassion, as you have a feeling that you'll need it later if you hope to do your part in battling Astaroth's plan.;Original
1077882;A Heart Blackened by Despise;Original
1077883;You recognize the crystal ball as the one from your vision.;Original
1077884;As you peer into the crystal ball, an image begins to form.;Original
1077885;You see a very young ogre hiding at the back of his cave.;Original
1077886;The ogre is watching a horrifying scene unfold before him.;Original
1077887;A party of rage driven humans is torturing his family.;Original
1077888;They are taking great pleasure in killing the ogre's family...;Original
1077889;...as slowly and gruesomely as possible.;Original
1077890;Tears silently stream down the young ogre's face.;Original
1077891;You somehow hear him vow in his heart to grow up...;Original
1077892;...and become the biggest and strongest ogre of them all...;Original
1077893;...so that he might spend the rest of his days...;Original
1077894;...seeking revenge against all of humanity.;Original
1077895;As the image dissolves, you are shown a large heart...;Original
1077896;...blackened, twisted and utterly consumed by...;Original
1077897;...despise. You tremble at the horrible image before you.;Original
1077898;The image finally fades, but not before you catch a glimpse...;Original
1077899;...of Astaroth laughing, all too pleased with his handiwork. ;Original

1077921;For Great Justice!;Original
1077922;As you meditate on the virtue of Justice, you find yourself envisioning a dusty skeleton, shackled to a wall. As you ponder the skeleton's existence, a feeling a great injustice washes over you suddenly.<br><br>As you step back from the shrine and open your eyes, the feeling subsides, leaving you with the strong desire to right this great wrong, whatever it may be.;Original
1077923;Once again, the image of a skeleton shackled to a wall leaps to the forefront of your mind.;Original
1077924;You place the rusty pen on the shrine and begin to meditate.<br><br>The injustice done to both Nina and Thomas stirs a feeling of great sadness inside of you. Though the record has finally been set straight after all these years, you can't help but to think that after all the executioner had done he deserved a far worse punishment than death.<br><br>You vow to meditate more on the Virtue of Justice in your future travels so that you might better understand how to temper your feelings with Love.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that the pen has been transformed by Justice! Stepping up to the shrine, you take the Pen of Justice, as your intuition tells you that you'll need it eventually on your quest to thwart Astaroth.;Original
1077925;That skeleton you’re poking at has a history, you know. ‘Tis all that is left of a boy that went by the name of Thomas. He was convicted for murder! A great injustice the whole farce turned out to be. I wrote his true story down in a journal, but the executioner found it. Even though I only had a few years left to serve, he had me executed on the spot.<br><br>I bet if you found my journal, you could clear Thomas’ name! Unfortunately, I don’t know where the executioner kept his things. Perhaps deeper in this prison?;Original
1077926;Well, it's certainly up to you, but it would be nice for Thomas' name to be cleared after all this time...;Original
1077927;You've failed to deliver the journal to someone who can clear Thomas' name! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost.;Original
1077928;Why are you standing around here talking to a ghost? Get moving!;Original
1077929;What's this? Why, yes, I do remember this case. It was quite a few years ago, but something seemed fishy about it back then and I've thought about the boy and his betrothed off and on since then.<br><br>*Andy reads the journal entry*<br><br>By the Virtues! I knew Thomas was innocent! Thank you so much for bringing this to me, I will make sure that the official record is changed as soon as possible. It won't undo the injustice done to Thomas, but it's the least we can do. Though, perhaps there is something more to be done...;Original
1077930;OooooOOOOoooOOOooO... oh, wait, you can actually hear me.;Original

1077932;This skeleton is awfully dusty!;Original
1077933;Thomas' Story;Original
1077934;I'm pretty sure that the journal can be found deeper inside the dungeon.;Original
1077935;You've found the journal! Return to the Prisoner's Ghost with it.;Original
1077936;Is that it? Hold it up here so I can read it and make sure it's my journal.;Original
1077937;A Journal Delivery;Original
1077938;'Tis my journal! It's strange to see it after all these years.<br><br>All that's left to do is to take it to someone that can change the official record. Perhaps someone at a court?<br><br>Maybe I can finally rest in peace!;Original

1077941;Heart of Compassion;Original
1077942;As you meditate on the virtue of Sacrifice, you envision a dark, watery cavern. As your mind wanders through the cave, you realize that there is treasure piled high against the wall. As you focus on the piles of gold and gems, a feeling of unbridled covetous washes over you with such force that your mind recoils away from the treasure.<br><br>It is at that moment that you realize you are being watched, as you spot a dark form moving amongst the shadows; its eyes watching, ever-vigilant, over the hoard.<br><br>You know you must find the source of this overwhelming greed if you are to continue down this path.;Original
1077943;A True Sacrifice;Original

1077950;You place Sudiva's Tear on the shrine and begin to meditate on the Virtue of Sacrifice. You find yourself sympathizing with Sudiva's plight. Although the great dragon played no small role in bringing her own self to her current condition, your feel that no living being should be made to suffer so, regardless of how it happened.<br><br>Your sacrifice has begun her healing process; hopefully someday she will be free from Astaroth's grip and can fly once against amongst the clouds.<br><br>When you open your eyes, you notice that Sudiva's Tear has transformed into a Tear of Sacrifice.

1077981;Only one last task remains for you to help oppose Astaroth's growing power. Take the purified candle I just gave you, enter the Candle of Love Cavern below us, and touch your flame to the Candle of Love.<br><br>This isn't quite as simple as it sounds, as you'll need to do two things. First, remember to hold the purified candle in your hand to cross the area of darkness. Once you've done that, you will encounter a puzzle to solve that helps to protect the Candle of Love. Solve this puzzle, and touch your flame to the candle quickly, as you won't have much time once you've crossed the lava.<br><br>Before you go, I wish to thank you for all that you have done.

1078005;The Code of Bushido;Original
1078006;Greetings! If you wish to learn skills that complement the Samurai profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>Hamato teaches Bushido. I suggest talking to him first. Bushido is the way of life for a Samurai. A Samurai can honorably execute his enemies or even evade powerful attacks such as dragon's breath or lightning bolts.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<br><br>Andreas Vesalius teaches Anatomy. Knowledge of the flesh helps a Samurai in several ways. Knowing where to strike an opponent helps you maximize your damage, knowing where to apply a bandage helps you heal better and you can even size up your opponent's strength and dexterity.<br><br>Avicenna teaches Healing. As a Samurai, you're going to find yourself face to face with your foes, which means you will get hurt; sometimes badly. Knowing how to heal yourself and your allies is an invaluable skill for any Samurai.<br><br>Tyl Ariadne teaches Parrying. The more skilled you are at deflecting your opponent's blows, the longer you'll last in battle.<br><br>Alden Armstrong teaches Tactics. This is a very important skill to have, as knowing how to handle a weapon does not really teach you how to use it against an opponent. Mastering Tactics will give you the knowledge to ensure your blows deal heavy damage against your foe.<br><br>Hamato is located at the School of Bushido. The other instructors are located at the Warrior Guild Hall.<br><br>Always remember...<br><br>A man who is a warrior by trade should calm his mind and look into the depths of others. Doing so is the way to becoming a legendary Samurai and the way to true Enlightenment.;Original
1078007;The Way of the Samurai;Original
1078008;Your Bushido potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.;Original
1078009;You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Samurai. Your Bushido potential is not enhanced here.;Original
1078010;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. use the Confidence defensive stance and attempt to honorably execute monsters there until you have raised your Bushido skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Greetings. I see you wish to learn the Way of the Samurai. Wielding a blade is easy. Anyone can grasp a sword's hilt. Learning how to fight properly and skillfully is to become an Armsman. Learning how to master weapons, and even more importantly when not to use them, is the Way of the Warrior. The Way of the Samurai. The Code of the Bushido. That is why you are here.<br><br>Adventure east to Old Haven. Use the Confidence defensive stance and attempt to honorably execute the undead that inhabit there.<br><br>If you fail to honorably execute the undead, your defenses will be greatly weakened: Resistances will suffer and Resisting Spells will suffer. A successful parry instantly ends the weakness. If you succeed, however, you will be infused with strength and healing. Your swing speed will also be boosted for a short duration. With practice, you will learn how to master your Bushido abilities.<br><br>Return to me once you feel that you have become an Apprentice Samurai.;Original
1078011;Good journey to you. Return to me if you wish to live the life of a Samurai.;Original
1078012;You are not ready to become an Apprentice Samurai. There are still more undead to lay to rest. Return to me once you have done so.;Original
1078013;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Samurai. Return to Hamato in New Haven to report your progress.;Original
1078014;You have proven yourself young one. You will continue to improve as your skills are honed with age. You are an honorable warrior, worthy of the rank of Apprentice Samurai.  Please accept this no-dachi as a gift. It is called "The Dragon's Tail". Upon a successful strike in combat, there is a chance this mighty weapon will replenish your stamina equal to the damage of your attack. I hope "The Dragon's Tail" serves you well. You have earned it. Farewell for now.;Original

1078035;How do you do? If you wish to learn skills that complement the Necromancer profession, seek out the following instructors:<br><br>Mulcivikh teaches Necromancy. I suggest seeking him out first. Necromancy is the study of dark magic. You can curse your foes, animate the dead, transform into wicked creatures, and summon some of the most deadly spells in the world.<br><br>Morganna teaches Spirit Speak. This skill allows you to heal yourself by channeling spiritual energy from either a corpse or yourself.<br><br>Gustar teaches Meditation. This skill allows someone to regenerate mana at an accelerated rate.<br><br>Jockles teaches Swordsmanship. You will want to know how to handle a weapon. Without this skill, you will find your blows miss more often than not.<br><br>Kaelynna teaches Magery. This skill allows one to cast spells that can heal, transport, weaken, and even slay opponents with fireballs and lightning bolts. Magery spells can also summon elementals and powerful daemons to aid the caster in battle.<br><br>Alefian teaches Resisting Spells which allows someone to lessen the severity of spells that lower your stats or ones that last for a specific duration of time.<br><br>Mulcivikh and Morganna are located here in the Necromancer School. Jockles is located in the Warrior Guild Hall, and the other instructors are located throughout the New Haven Magery School.<br><br>Soon, the secrets of the netherworld will be revealed to you.;Original
1078036;The Allure of Dark Magic;Original
1078037;Your Necromancy potential is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.;Original
1078038;You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Necromancer. Your Necromancy potential is not enhanced here.;Original
1078039;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Cast Evil Omen and Pain Spike against monsters there and eventually animate their dead corpses until you have raised your Necromancy skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>Welcome! I see you are allured by the dark magic of Necromancy. First, you must prove yourself worthy of such knowledge. Undead currently occupy the town of Old Haven. Practice your harmful Necromancy spells on them such as Evil Omen and Pain Spike. When you are able, animate their corpses into undead. They will follow you and kill any enemies in their path.<br><br>Make sure you have plenty of reagents before embarking on your journey. Reagents are required to cast Necromancy spells. You can purchase extra reagents from me, or you can find reagents growing in the nearby wooded areas. You can see which reagents are required for each spell by looking in your spellbook.<br><br>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Necromancer and I will reward you with the knowledge you desire.;Original
1078040;You are weak after all. Come back to me when you are ready to practice Necromancy.;Original
1078041;You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Necromancer. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Necromancer and I will reward you with the knowledge you desire.;Original
1078042;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Necromancer. Return to Mulcivikh in New Haven to receive the knowledge you desire.;Original
1078043;You have done well, my young apprentice. Behold! I now present to you the knowledge you desire. This spellbook contains all the Necromancer spells. The power is intoxicating, isn't it?;Original
1078044;Channeling the Supernatural;Original
1078045;You ability to channel the supernatural is greatly enhanced while questing in this area.;Original
1078046;You are not in the quest area for Apprentice Medium. Your ability to channel the supernatural potential is not enhanced here.;Original
1078047;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Use Spirit Speak and channel energy from either yourself or nearby corpses there. You can also cast Necromancy spells as well to raise Spirit Speak. Do these activities until you have raised your Spirit Speak skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>How do you do? Channeling the supernatural through Spirit Speak allows you heal your wounds. Such channeling expends your mana, so be mindful of this. Spirit Speak enhances the potency of your Necromancy spells. The channeling powers of a Medium are quite useful when practicing the dark magic of Necromancy.<br><br>It is best to practice Spirit Speak where there are a lot of corpses. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Undead currently reside there. Use Spirit Speak and channel energy from either yourself or nearby corpses. You can also cast Necromancy spells as well to raise Spirit Speak.<br><br>Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Medium and I will reward you with something useful.;Original
1078048;Channeling the supernatural isn't for everyone. It is a dark art. See me if you ever wish to pursue the life of a Medium.;Original
1078049;Back so soon? You have not achieved the rank of Apprentice Medium. Come back to me once you feel that you are worthy of the rank of Apprentice Medium and I will reward you with something useful.;Original
1078050;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Medium. Return to Morganna in New Haven to receive your reward.;Original
1078051;Well done! Channeling the supernatural is taxing, indeed. As promised, I will reward you with this bag of Necromancer reagents. You will need these if you wish to also pursue the dark magic of Necromancy. Good journey to you.;Original

1078063;You feel much more attuned to your mace. Your ability to hone your Mace Fighting skill is enhanced in this area.;Original
1078064;You feel less attuned to your mace. Your Mace Fighting learning potential is no longer enhanced.;Original
1078065;Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. While wielding your mace, battle monsters there until you have raised your Mace Fighting skill to 50.<br><center>------</center><br>I see you want to learn a real weapon and not the toothpick training Jockles has to offer. Real warriors are called Armsmen, and they wield mace weapons. No doubt about it. Nothing is more satisfying than knocking the wind out of your enemies, smashing their armor, crushing their bones, and taking their names.<br><br>Want to learn how to wield a mace? Well, I have an assignment for you. Head East out of town and go to Old Haven. Undead have plagued the town, so there are plenty of bones for you to smash there.<br><br>Come back to me after you feel you have achieved the rank of Apprentice Armsman, and I will reward you with a real weapon.;Original
1078066;I thought you wanted to be an Armsman and really make something of yourself. You have potential, kid, but if you want to play with toothpicks, run to Jockles and he will teach you how to clean your teeth with a sword. If you change your mind, come back to me, and I will show you how to wield a real weapon.;Original
1078067;Listen kid. There are a lot of undead in Old Haven, and you haven't smashed enough of them yet. So get back there and do some more cleansing.;Original
1078068;You have achieved the rank of Apprentice Armsman. Return to Churchill in New Haven to claim your reward.;Original
1078069;Now that's what I'm talking about! Well done! Don't you like crushing bones and taking names? As I promised, here is a war mace for you. It hits hard. It swings fast. It hits often. What more do you need? Now get out of here and crush some more enemies!;Original

3010117;Aggressive monsters do not automatically attack you.<br><br>Vendors will buy back most items that you purchased for their full value.<br><br>You are offered special quests if you selected one of the templates during character creation.<br><br>Other players cannot attack or steal from you.<br><br>Poisoned weapons do not poison you.<br><br>You can use level zero treasure maps.<br><br>Other players cannot loot the corpses of monsters you have slain.<br><br>When you die, you are teleported to the nearest healer, and retain all your possessions.;Original
3010118;You cannot poison others with poisoned weapons.<br><br>You cannot join a faction.;Original
3010119;Your stats are the physical and mental attributes of your character, each of which affects other sub-characteristics of your character.  Stats increase automatically based on the skills you use, up to a maximum of 100 in any single stat, and no more than 225 in total stat points.  If you have reached the 225 stat maximum, and one of your stats increases, one of the other two stats is randomly lowered to make room.;Original
3010120;Strength is the physical essence of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are determined by your Strength.<br><br>Your maximum carry capacity in stones is calculated by: (Strength * 7) / 2) + 40.<br><br>You receive a melee percentage damage bonus of: Strength / 5.;Original
3010121;Hit Points are a numerical measure of your ability to survive damage.  The more Hit Points you have, the tougher you are.  If your Hit Points ever go below zero, you will die.<br><br>Your Hit Points are calculated by: (Strength / 2) + 50.  Magical bonuses to your Strength add directly to your Hit Points at a ratio of 1 to 1.;Original
3010122;Intelligence is the mental capacity of your character.<br><br>Your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is determined by your Intelligence.<br><br>Your Intelligence affects the rate at which your <a href="?24">Mana</a> is regained.;Original
3010123;Your Mana is the energy that allows you to cast <a href="?35">Magic</a>.  After expending Mana to cast a spell, it slowly recovers at a rate described in the Meditation skill section.  Your maximum Mana is the same as your <a href="?23">Intelligence</a> statistic.;Original
3010124;Dexterity is your hand-to-eye coordination and reflexes.<br><br><a href="?26">Stamina</a> is determined by your Dexterity.;Original
3010125;Your Stamina determines how fast you can swing a weapon.  The more Stamina you have, the faster you'll swing.  Your maximum Stamina is the same as your <a href="?25">Dexterity</a> statistic.  Several factors reduce your Stamina, including: taking damage, running, and special wrestling moves.<br><br>When you are in a non-consensual PVP area, pushing through players and monsters reduces your Stamina by 10, and you cannot push through unless you are at maximum Stamina.;Original
3010126;In your travels throughout UO, you will eventually find yourself locked in combat with an enemy, be it monster or player.  Weapons, <a href="?35">Magic</a>, and allies can all be used to slay your foe, and should be, for a fight persists until someone runs away, someone dies, or all combatants voluntarily cease fighting.;Original
3010127;To attack an enemy, you must first enter War Mode by clicking the War/Peace button on your <a href="?2">Paperdoll</a> (it will read 'Peace', since you are currently in Peace mode).  Once clicked, the button turns red, the text changes to War, and your character enters a fighting stance.  Double-clicking an enemy while in War Mode initiates an attack and places you in combat with them.<br><br>To leave War Mode, click the War button or press Tab.  Leaving War Mode ceases your attack.  Be careful, for it is unlikely your opponent will stop attacking you.<br><br>When you are first attacked, even while not in War Mode, you will automatically defend yourself.;Original
3010128;When you take damage from weapon or <a href="?35">Magic</a>, your <a href="?22">Hit Points</a> are lowered.  You can raise them through being healed, unless they go below zero, in which case you will die.  You are considered to be in full health when your Hit Points are at their maximum, and you should try to maintain this state whenever possible.<br><br>You can heal with bandages by double-clicking a bandage (or stack of bandages) and targeting yourself.  This method is best suited for warriors, as it uses the Healing and Anatomy skills to determine your success.  Applying a bandage takes several seconds, and each time you take damage during that time reduces your effectiveness, so take care to run away from combat until the bandaging is complete.<br><br>Those skilled in Magery will most likely find the healing spells In Mani and In Vas Mani much more to their liking.<br><br>Those inclined in the way of the Paladin, may also use their <a href="?100">Close Wounds</a> ability to heal themselves.<br><br>Should you find yourself wounded and completely without skill in the healing arts, another player can heal you at least as well as, and often better than, they could heal themselves...if asked politely. If you are <a href="?16">Young</a>, a wandering <a href="?31">NPC</a> healer will cast spells to heal you when you approach.;Original
3010129;When an enemy is slain, not just anyone can loot treasure from the corpse.  The right to loot is determined by the amount of damage done, with substantial weight added for those who struck the initial and killing blow.  In non-consensual PVP areas, you are allowed to loot corpses without proper rights, but doing so will flag you as a criminal and is extremely likely to paint a target on your chest.;Original
3010130;Non-Player Characters, or NPCs, are living creatures controlled by the game engine.  They may react to your actions depending on the who, where, when and how of the situation.  The three main types of NPCs are: <a href="?32">Monsters</a>, <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a>, and <a href="?34">Vendors</a>.;Original
3010131;Monsters are the ever-present inhabitants of Britannia.  Most of them are terribly aggressive, and attack on sight.  A much smaller group tries to live in peace, signified by the blue coloring of their name.  Should you decide to bring your wrath upon these peace-loving denizens, your karma will eventually be lowered until you are recognized and attacked without provocation by even them.  You can gain good standing again by slaying exclusively those monsters aggressive to everyone.;Original
3010132;Shopkeepers buy and sell goods.  They only buy that which they sell, and their stores automatically restock several times each hour, increasing to even larger amounts when completely bought out.  To interact with a shopkeeper, left-click them to display their interactive menu, and select either Buy or Sell.  If they are near enough to their shop, an appropriate menu pops up and business commences!;Original
3010133;A vendor is a type of player-run shopkeeper who sells only goods placed on them by their owner, at prices set by their owner.  Vendors can only be placed in their owner's house, and they do not wander.  You can browse their inventory by double-clicking them and rummaging through their backpack just as you would your own.  Single left-clicking items shows you the description of the item, as well as the price.  If you wish to purchase something, say 'vendor buy' and target the item.  You are then asked to confirm your purchase.  Remember, the money is taken directly from your bank, so you don't need to travel with large sums of gold if you go on a shopping spree.;Original
3010134;Magic is common in the lands of Ultima Online, used by all and mastered by some.  When you try to cast a spell, your Magery skill and the spell circle determine your chance for success.  If successful, your Mana is lowered by an amount required by the spell.  High circle spells are more difficult to cast, and require a fair amount of Mana and skill in Magery before they may even be attempted.  Additionally, you must possess either a spellbook or scroll containing the spell you wish to cast.<br><br>If you use a spellbook, you must also have in your backpack the reagents required to cast the spell. See <a href="?36">Spellbooks</a> for more information.<br><br>If you use a scroll, reagents are not required, and the level of the spell is 2 circles lower for purposes of minimum Magery required and success rate.  Once successfully cast, the scroll is consumed.  Double-click a scroll to cast from it.<br><br>While casting, your hands must be free.  There is one exception, in that you may hold a spellbook in your hands if desired.;Original
3010135;Spellbooks contain a collection of permanently inscribed spells for casting.  You may open a spellbook by double-clicking it and then flip through the pages to see which spells it contains.<br><br>If you flip to the page containing a spell, you will find a listing of the reagents required and a small representative icon.  Double-clicking the icon attempts to cast the spell.  If you drag the icon from the spellbook and drop it in the gameplay window, it behaves just as if it were in the spellbook when double-clicked, creating a handy shortcut for casting the spell.<br><br>To add a spell to your spellbook: obtain a scroll with the desired spell, and then drag and drop the scroll onto your spellbook.;Original
3010136;Reagents are the material components used to cast a spell.  They are also used by those skilled in Alchemy to create magical potions, and are thus highly sought after in the lands of Britannia.<br><br>Reagents are purchased from <a href="?33">Shopkeepers</a> in the magical and alchemical trades, and it is not uncommon to find a <a href="?34">Vendor</a> stocked with reagents as well.  They can even be picked up off the ground.  These ground-dwelling reagents tend to thrive in areas to which they are indigenous; you might find Spider Silk in a graveyard or Sulfurous Ash near a volcano.;Original
3010137;Your bankbox is highly magical in that it is completely secure, and contains the same contents regardless of where you open it.  Your bankbox can contain no more than 125 items, but has no weight restrictions.  Stacks of items count as a single item towards the item limit.<br><br>To open your bankbox: locate a banker or minter inside a bank, left-click them to view their interactive menu and select Open Bankbox.  You can also stand next to a bank and say the word, 'Bank.';Original
3010138;Your skills define your character.  They are the activities in which your character most often participates and, with enough practice, excels.  Skills have a maximum trained value of 100.0, although they can go beyond that limit with rare magical items.  Additionally, you cannot exceed a total of 700 total skill points in all skills combined.;Original
3010139;Each time you use a skill, there is a chance it will increase.  Many skills grant you a much better chance to increase if the attempt is difficult relative to its current value; these are referred to as Difficulty Based skills.  For example, around 75.0 Swordsmanship, you have a fairly good chance to gain skill by swinging your sword at an earth elemental, and almost no chance when taking on a cow or rabbit.<br><br>You can quickly get a rudimentary amount of skill from an NPC trainer.  To train, left-click an <a href="?31">NPC</a> to view their interactive menu, and select the skill you wish to train.  The NPC will tell you how much it costs to advance in the skill.   Then, just drag and drop the proper amount of gold onto them.  Note that not all NPCs can train.<br><br>If ever you find yourself in a rut and not gaining skill, first ensure you are really able to gain (see <a href="?42">Skill Locks</a>).  If everything looks good, simply try changing things up a bit - explore or try a different target.  It might just get you out of that rut, or at least make it an interesting time trying.;Original
3010140;Practice dummies provide a safe way to learn the basics of combat and stealing - up to 25.0 points in the respective skill.  To use a practice dummy, just move in close and double-click it.  For combat practice dummies, you'll have to wield the weapon in which you wish to train before double-clicking.;Original
3010141;Skill Locks grant you control over your skill advancement, and are manipulated in the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>.  To open the <a href="?7">Skills Menu</a>, press the Skills button on your Paperdoll.  A small icon is located next to each skill.  An arrow pointing up signifies the skill can only advance.  A lock signifies the skill cannot advance or degrade.  An arrow pointing down signifies the skill cannot advance, and will eventually degrade if another skill is increased while you are at your skill total maximum.  This is very important, because if no skills are pointed down once at your skill total maximum, you cannot gain in any skill.;Original
3010142;Fame represents how well-known you are by deeds such as completing both quests and bulk order deeds, and killing monsters worth more Fame than your current level.  If you reach a high level of Fame, your professional title becomes viewable by anyone who looks at your Paperdoll.<br><br>Each time your character dies, they lose 10% of their Fame.;Original
3010143;Karma is a measure of both the good and evil deeds you have done, and is raised and lowered by a large and diverse number of activities.  Raising your Karma might be accomplished by killing evil NPCs, giving gold to good NPCs, or casting beneficial spells on other players.  Your Karma could be lowered by using the Snooping, Stealing, Begging, or Poisoning skill, summoning Daemons, or killing good NPCs.<br><br>Your Karma affects your title.  If your Karma ever drops to the lowest level, NPC shopkeepers will refuse to do business with you.  Player-run Vendors will continue to do business with you, however.;Original
3010144;The chance to learn a skill is increased during the first hour of play each day for each character on your account. Note this only affects the chance to increase a skill, not the chance to succeed in using it.<br><br>You will experience a power hour during your first hour of play for each character within a 24 hour period, which means that technically, the power hour will be refreshed 23 hours after the previous power hour has ended, per character. If any character does not log in for over 24 hours, their power hour will begin as soon as they log in, and last for one full hour. Every character on your account has their own burst hour.<br><br>As an example, a player who logs in at 8:00 PM local time will experience a power hour that will last until 9:00 PM. They will not be able to experience another power hour during that 24 hour period, so they will not receive another power hour until at least 8:00 PM the following day. If they do not log in again until 10:00 PM, they will experience their full power hour, beginning at 10:00 PM and lasting until 11:00 PM. The following day, they will not be able to experience a power hour until at least 10:00 PM local time.<br><br>The times stated above are YOUR time - they are not based on any form of server time. Server time zones have nothing to do with your power hour times.<br><br>Your burst time does not carry over to another day. If you don't use your entire burst hour in any 24 hour period, you forfeit any unused time.<br><br>To benefit most from your power hour, you need to use it all at once. If you log in at 10am, play for half an hour, and log out, power hour for that character will expire at 11am. It is not saved for later.<br><br>The burst system does not affect non-difficulty skills that are below base 70.0, like Anatomy, Evaluating Intelligence, and Meditation. Difficulty skills are those like Tailoring, Carpentry, and Magery, where there are always more difficult levels to attain.;Original
3010145;Public Moongates can be used to travel to various destinations throughout the land.  To use a moongate, simply step into it and choose your destination when prompted.  Once you select a destination, you will be instantly teleported there.;Original

3010150;Plant Growing;Original
3010151;Using special seeds harvested from slain monsters, you may grow uniquely colored plants to use as house decorations or to produce hybrid seeds and resources. <BR><BR> As your plant grows from a seed to a full-grown plant, it will need watering and alchemical care in order to protect if from insect infestations and harmful fungi.<BR><BR>Through the process of cross-pollination, you may even be the first person to grow a unique new hybrid plant type!;Original
3010152;Plant Bowl;Original
3010153;In order to plant a seed, you first need a special bowl.  Plant bowls can be purchased from a provisioner for a small price.<BR><BR>Once you have an empty plant bowl, you'll need to fill it with dirt before you can plant a seed in it.<BR><BR>To fill a plant bowl with dirt, double-click the bowl to use it, and then target a source of nice soft brown dirt.  If you've targeted an appropriate patch of dirt, you'll now have a bowl full of dirt.  Add in enough water to soften the dirt, and you'll have a perfect spot for planting a <a href="?50">seed</a>!;Original
3010154;Plant Seeds;Original
3010155;Plant seeds come in many different colors.  When planted in a <a href="?49">bowl of dirt</a> and carefully tended to over time, plant seeds will grow into full-grown plants.  These plants can be used for <a href="?70">decorative purposes</a> only, or as a source of new <a href="?66">hybrid</a> plant seeds and specially grown <a href="?69">resources</a>.<BR><BR>While you can tell what color of plant the seed will grow into by the color of the seed itself, the type of plant that results from a particular seed remains a mystery until the plant is fully-grown!<BR><BR>The first step in growing a seed into a plant is planting it in a bowl of soft dirt.  In order to plant a seed, simply double-click the seed to use it, and then target a bowl of soft dirt.  Freshly dug dirt isn't soft enough for a seed to be planted in, so you'll need to pour <a href="?61">water</a> into your bowl of dirt before attempting to place a seed in it.;Original
3010156;Plant Growth;Original
3010157;Plants take time to grow through their various stages.  A plant has nine main stages of growth, from <a href="?50">seed</a>, to sapling, to fully grown plant.  Plants will not grow in containers, unless the container is in a player's backpack.  If a plant is <a href="?52">healthy</a> and well-tended, it will grow one "stage" of its life-cycle in about a day's time.  If a plant is not healthy because it has not been well taken care of, then it will not grow.  You must keep your plant in a healthy state by curing it of any maladies that might be affecting it, and then letting it heal naturally or help it along through <a href="?63">alchemical means</a>.;Original
3010158;Plant Health;Original
3010159;Plants have hit points much like your character.  A plant loses hit points when it is affected by various maladies.  If a plant has <a href="?53">insects</a> eating at it, then it will lose hit points each day.  Other maladies that can affect a plant's health include under or over-<a href="?61">watering</a> the plant, harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>, <a href="?57">poison</a>, and <a href="?59">disease</a>.<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal potions</a> and a plant's natural healing will raise the plant's hit points back up to its maximum, but only if the plant has been cured of all maladies first.<BR><BR>If a plant loses all its hit points, it will die.<BR><BR>As a plant grows, its maximum health increases.  Seeds and saplings are very weak, and can easily be killed if neglected for even a short while.  Full-grown plants, on the other hand, could survive for several days without any help.;Original
3010160;Infestation;Original
3010161;As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infested by insects.  These insects will slowly eat at a plant, causing it to lose <a href="?52">health</a> and eventually die.  Different plants have different chances of being infested.  Flowery plants, over-watered plants, and bright plants all have a greater chance of attracting hungry insects, so they’ll need even more attention from their owner.<BR><BR>You can use <a href="?57">poison potions</a> on your plant in order to kill off the insects that have infested it.  Be sure that you do not use too much poison, however, or your plant will soak up the poison, which can cause it to wither and die!<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?54">Infestation Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.;Original
3010162;Infestation Level;Original
3010163;The Infestation Level meter (grey bug image) shows the relative amount of <a href="?53">insects</a> that are currently attacking your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small infestation.  A red + sign indicates a severe infestation.;Original
3010164;Fungus;Original
3010165;As a plant grows, it has a chance of being infected with harmful fungi.  Fungi sap the plant of its health, which will cause it to wither and die.  It is important to remember that fungi love moist areas, so over-watering your plant increases the chance that it will become infected by harmful fungi.<BR><BR>You may cure your plant of fungus by using <a href="?59">cure potions</a>.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?56">Fungus Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.;Original
3010166;Fungus Level;Original
3010167;The Fungus Level meter (mushroom image) shows the amount of <a href="?55">fungi</a> that are currently sapping health from your plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign means the plant has a small fungus infection.  A red + sign indicates a severe fungus infection.;Original
3010168;Poison (Plants);Original
3010169;You may apply poison potions to your plant to kill insects infesting it.  If you apply too many poison potions, however, or apply poison potions when there are no insects on the plant, then your plant will soak up the poison and become sick.<BR><BR>When you apply poison potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as <a href="?53">insects</a> only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any insects will be killed off by your poison potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally poison your plant, you can cure the plant of poison by using <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the poison.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?58">Poison Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.;Original

3010172;Curing (Plants);Original
3010173;You may apply cure potions to a plant in order to cure it of harmful <a href="?55">fungi</a>. If you apply too many cure potions, however, or apply cure potions when the plant is not infected by fungi, you will infect your plant with a deadly disease which will cause it to wither and die.<BR><BR>When you apply cure potions, they will not take effect until the next <a href="?51">growth check</a> your plant performs (approximately once a day).  Don't worry, however, as fungi only harm your plant during a growth check as well, so any harmful fungi will be cured by your cure potions before they can harm your plant.<BR><BR>If you accidentally infect your plant with a disease by over-curing it, you can use <a href="?64">heal potions</a> to counteract the disease.<BR><BR>You may view your plant's current <a href="?60">Disease Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.;Original
3010174;Disease Level;Original

3010176;Watering;Original
3010177;In order to keep your plant healthy, you must water it regularly.  An under-watered plant will wither and die if left unattended.  However, it is important to remember that over-watering your plant is also unhealthy.  Over-watered plants become waterlogged and lose <a href="?52">health</a>, in addition to becoming perfect breeding grounds for <a href="?53">insects</a> and <a href="?55">fungi</a>.<BR><BR>Each time a plant performs its <a href="?51">growth check</a> (approximately once a day), the plant will soak up one dose of water, so you'll need to keep a constant eye on your plant to make sure it has not dried out.<BR><BR>You can view your plant's current <a href="?62">Water Level</a> in the Plant Health menu.;Original
3010178;Water Level;Original
3010179;The Water Level meter (water pitcher image) shows the amount of <a href="?61">water</a> in your plant bowl.  Unlike other state meters, the Water Level meter displays both negative (under-watered) and positive (over-watered) levels.<BR><BR>A yellow - sign indicates the plant is slightly under-watered.  A red - sign indicates a severely under-watered plant.<BR><BR>A yellow + sign indicates the plant has been slightly over-watered.  A red + sign indicates the plant has been severely over-watered.;Original
3010180;Potions (Plants);Original
3010181;You may apply various potions to a plant in order to cure it of various maladies, help it to heal back up to maximum health, or strengthen it against infestations.  Potions are applied through the Water button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>The following potions may be used on plants :<BR><BR><a href="?64">Heal Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?59">Cure Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?57">Poison Potions</a><BR><BR><a href="?65">Strength Potions</a>;Original
3010182;Heal Potions (Plants);Original
3010183;You may apply heal potions to a plant in order to cure it of poison or disease.  Heal potions are applied during a plant's normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new heal potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.<BR><BR>If heal potions are applied to a plant that is not poisoned or diseased, and the plant has no other maladies currently affecting it, then the heal potions will be used to help increase the plant's current hit points (in addition to the natural healing a plant performs if it is not currently infected by any maladies).;Original
3010184;Strength Potions (Plants);Original
3010185;You may apply strength potions to a plant in order to help it resist insect infestations and fungus growth.  Each strength potion applied will lower the chance of infestation by harmful maladies.  Strength potions are soaked up by a plant during its normal <a href="?61">growth check</a>, so you will need to apply new strength potions each day if you want the plant to continue applying their beneficial effects.;Original
3010186;Cross-Pollination;Original
3010187;When a plant first reaches its full-grown state, it will sprout its full foliage, no longer contained within the plant bowl.  At this stage of the plant's growth, it will begin to produce pollen.  You can view your plant's current <a href="?67">Pollination State</a> in the Plant Resources Menu.  The plant will eventually self-pollinate if left unattended, and the plant will begin to produce <a href="?50">seeds</a>.  Seeds produced by a self-pollinated plant will grow up into an exact duplicate of the "parent" plant.<BR><BR>Another method of pollination is called "cross-pollination".  Once a plant reaches the pollen-producing stage, its pollen may be gathered by the owner by using the Cross-Pollination button.  Gathered pollen may be used on another full-grown plant.  When you pollinate one plant with pollen from another plant, the targeted plant will produce seeds that will grow into a hybrid of the two plants.  The color and type of each "parent" plant are combined to produce a new type of seed that will grow from the targeted plant.<BR><BR>While you may continue to gather pollen from a plant throughout its entire life cycle, once a plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural pollination, or through manual cross-pollination from another plant), no further combinations may be performed.  The seed type that the plant will produce is determined the first time the plant is pollinized, and cannot be changed afterwards.<BR><BR>In very rare circumstances, cross-pollination may result in a "mutation".  If mutation occurs, the targeted plant will not produce seeds that are a combination of the two "parent" plants, but will instead produce "mutated" seeds that grow into mutant plant varieties.;Original
3010188;Pollination State;Original
3010189;The Pollination State indicator displays the current pollination state of a plant.<BR><BR>A yellow - symbol indicates that the plant has not yet produced any pollen, as it has not reached full-grown level.<BR><BR>A red ! symbol indicates that the plant has entered its pollen producing state, and can have pollen gathered from it, or be <a href="?66">cross-pollinated</a> to.<BR><BR>A green + symbol indicates that the plant has been pollinated (either by itself, through natural self-pollination, or by the pollen of another plant).  While you can still gather pollen from a plant in this state, the plant can no longer be the target of cross-pollination.;Original
3010190;Seed Production;Original
3010191;When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, it will no longer grow in size, but will instead produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> any time a <a href="?51">growth check</a> is performed.<BR><BR>The type of seed that a plant produces is determined by whether it pollinated itself, or if pollen from another plant was applied to it during the <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a> process.<BR><BR>A plant will produce one seed per day, up to a maximum of eight seeds.  A plant will only produce a seed if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather seeds from a plant by using the Gather Seeds button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available seeds from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of seeds available is displayed next to the Seed # indicator (seed image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.;Original
3010192;Resource Production;Original
3010193;Certain plant type and color combinations result in a plant that can produce unique resources.<BR><BR>A plant will begin producing resources at the same time it produces <a href="?50">seeds</a>, when it reaches its maximum growth level.<BR><BR>One resource is produced per day, up to a maximum of eight resources.  A plant will only produce resources if it is <a href="?52">healthy</a>.<BR><BR>You may gather resources from a plant by using the Gather Resources button on the Resources menu.  You will pick all available resources from the plant and place them in your backpack, if there is room.<BR><BR>The number of resources available is displayed next to the Resource # indicator (petal image in an empty box).<BR><BR>A red X symbol indicates that the plant has been set to <a href="?70">decorative mode</a>, or has produced its maximum amount.<BR><BR>Resources produced by unique plant combinations have special properties dependant on the resource type and color.;Original
3010194;Decorative Mode;Original
3010195;When a plant reaches its maximum growth level, a Decorative Mode symbol will appear in the Resources Menu.  This symbol is displayed as a leafy plant with a red / symbol through it.<BR><BR>Pressing this button (and clicking Yes to apply) will set the plant to Decorative Mode.<BR><BR>A plant set to Decorative Mode will not produce <a href="?50">seeds</a> or <a href="?69">resources</a>, and cannot be used for <a href="?66">cross-pollination</a>.  A Decorative Plant does not need upkeep, however, and is always in a <a href="?52">healthy</a> state.<BR><BR>Decorative Mode should be activated if you simply want your plant to be used as a house decoration, and therefore do not want to have to water it or keep it healthy.<BR><BR>A Decorative Plant will have the tag [decorative] displayed above it when single-clicked.<BR><BR>IMPORTANT NOTE : Once a plant is set to Decorative Mode, it cannot be set back to its normal state.  A Decorative Plant will never produce seeds or resources again.;Original

3010197;If you would like to empty your plant bowl of the plant or seed and start over again, you may use the Empty Bowl button on the Main Menu.<BR><BR>If the plant in the bowl is in the <a href="?50">seed</a> or sapling stage, emptying the bowl will result in a bowl and the seed placed in your backpack.<BR><BR>If the bowl only had dirt in it, or the plant had grown beyond the sapling phase, emptying the bowl will destroy the plant, returning only the plant bowl to your backpack.;Original
